0. Add another column (4th one) to CSV when collecting words from mods - it is user's comment (defines as an argument for the script) and specify the mode where this word is taken from.
1. Collect dictionary (based on mod) - collect all the non-dictionary english words and keep adding new words
2. Make sure sript to translate works with real data, improve prompt over time (add information about all the <CHARACTER>, etc).
3. Create a script to put the information back into tra files
4. Improve the script that creates scv files with information from tra files that are not parts of the dialogs (we need it to at least use dictionary).
