@136   = ~A drink? Of course, dearie. After all, this is a tavern... plenty to drink here, heh heh.~
@137   = ~Yes, well... you see I'm in a bit of a bind right now. I've just run out of everything. I've nothing to offer you in the way of drink at this moment.~
@138   = ~Well, the tavern hasn't run completely dry. I do have some stock down in the cellar, but...~
@139   = ~This is rather embarrassing... but I'm having somewhat of a pest problem down in that dirty ol' cellar and I'm afraid to go down there. I do so hate bugs! Just the thought of those nasty creepies and crawlies sends shivers down my spine.~
@140   = ~That's awfully sweet of you, dearie. But I don't expect you to go to any trouble on my account. I'm sure I'll think of something.~
@141   = ~Wonderful! The stairs to the cellar are in the back room. Now you be careful down there, dearie, and don't let any of those little buggers creep back up here, all right?~
@142   = ~Hmm. I suppose I could scrape together a couple of coins as payment for such a service. Let me see... how about 5 gold? Would that do, dearie?~
@143   = ~Sorry, dearie. I haven't the time to chitchat with you. I've a tavern to run, you know. If you are looking to catch up on the local gossip, I suggest you buy a round or mingle with some of the other patrons.~
@144   = ~Hmph! Look, stranger... up here in Easthaven, we may be out on the frontier, but we do manage to act civilized toward one another. If you can't at least try to be polite, then there's the door, dearie.~
@145   = ~Well now! Aren't we the greedy one? The way I see it, five coins is better than no coins. Take it or leave it, dearie.~
@146   = ~Any luck getting rid of those nasty bugs, dearie? My customers are getting pretty thirsty.~
@147   = ~How about a drink?~
@148   = ~I have some questions for you.~

@151   = ~How about a drink?~
@152   = ~I have some questions for you.~
@153   = ~Nothing, thank you. Just passing through.~
@154   = ~Heh, heh. Yes, indeed.~
@155   = ~Well? What do you have?~
@156   = ~My, aren't you the sharp one? How about that drink?~
@157   = ~You've run out of everything?~
@158   = ~What kind of tavern are you running here?~
@159   = ~No spirits? That's it, I'm gone.~
@160   = ~But what?~
@161   = ~Well, I suggest you march on down there and get me something to drink, woman.~
@162   = ~Yes. I think I should be leaving. Farewell.~
@163   = ~I see. Is there anything I can do to help?~
@164   = ~A big girl like you afraid of bugs? Come on, show a little backbone.~
@165   = ~Great, a tavern with no booze and bugs to boot. I can't wait to see the rest of this town.~
@166   = ~I'll just come back when you've solved your little problem. Farewell.~
@167   = ~Have no fear, madam. I shall see to it that the pests down below trouble you no further.~
@168   = ~I could see to your pest problem... for a price, of course.~
@169   = ~Well, best of luck to you. Farewell.~
@170   = ~Five is plenty. Your pests are as good as gone.~
@171   = ~It'll do, though it's hardly a fair sum for such a service.~
@172   = ~Five gold! What will I ever do with such a treasure? Stop wasting my time.~
@173   = ~Thank you, dearie. You're a lifesaver. Just do me one more favor... keep this little bug problem between you and me. I don't want folks thinking Grisella's place isn't clean. Run along now.~
@174   = ~On second thought, forget it. I'll drink somewhere else.~
@175   = ~All right, how about a drink?~
@176   = ~All right, how about a drink?~
@177   = ~Very well, I'll leave you to your work. Farewell.~
@178   = ~My apologies. Is there anything I can do to help with your problem?~
@179   = ~Right. I'm off then. Farewell.~
@180   = ~All right, all right. I'll take the job for five gold.~
@181   = ~Right. I'm off then. Farewell.~
@182   = ~Not just yet. I'm working on it, though.~
@183   = ~In due time—and stop calling me dearie! It's just plain silly!~
@184   = ~It is done. Those bugs won't be troubling you anymore.~
@185   = ~Thank you. Before I go, I would like to purchase some spells.~
@186   = ~Hello. My name is Accalia. I'm an initiate here at the temple of Tempus. I help Everard maintain the temple armory and perform rituals.~
@187   = ~Tempus is revered a great deal by the barbarian tribes up here. They call him "Tempos." We immigrants see a lot of conflict and violence in these parts, and people want to make sense out of it all.~
@188   = ~We celebrate the Feast of the Moon in remembrance of the battle dead. We also sing the Song of the Sword at least once a tenday. Because of the church's close proximity to the site of so many great battles, our congregation also has local celebrations to remember all of the mighty conflicts that have raged across Icewind Dale. The most important daily ceremonies are the Feast of Heroes at highsun and the Song for the Fallen at sunset.~
@189   = ~It changes from season to season, from year to year... like all things. They are mistrustful of us immigrants and often view our settlements here as an intrusion on their land. Sometimes they trade with us, sometimes they war with us.~
@190   = ~It is actually part of a simple truth that we Tempurans believe. Conflict is all around us. Every man and woman has something that he or she believes in, which he or she will die to promote or preserve. Tempus tells us that we should live for something of importance. If we kill, if we die... the same. We preach that conflict and war are vital to mankind's existence.~
@191   = ~The point is that it's not "gloomy." It's not an end unto itself. Conflict, war—they are the means to an end. Tempus does not determine the merit of a cause. He simply measures the valor and dedication of those who are brave enough to fight, kill and die for what they believe in.~
@192   = ~I am originally from Neverwinter. I came here to aid Battlelord Everard when the former Warpriest, Renfeld, was killed in a battle against the barbarians near Bryn Shander.~
@193   = ~True, the church of Myrkul does perform ceremonies for the dead, but that foul god does them no honor. Tempus holds a special place in his heart for those who have died in battle, showing valor and passion. We celebrate their deaths to show respect for a life given to battle.~
@194   = ~We celebrate the Battle of Jerrod's Stone. I'd tell you more about it, but Everard prefers that any questions about it be directed to him... he has somewhat of a different perspective on the teachings than most. Ask him about it if you see him.~
@195   = ~They're pretty straightforward. The Feast of Heroes is a meal that we eat at highsun. During it, we remember the final meal which each warrior eats before he or she enters mortal battle. The Song for the Fallen is a dirge that we sing at sunset as a daily memorial for those who have died in battle.~
@196   = ~It is just part of our daily routine. We know that the barbarians are just a few peaks away and we immigrants understand the danger that they bring into our lives.~
@197   = ~That is exceptionally rude. We are different from the barbarians, but they are honorable people who brave extremely harsh conditions and live proud lives. I do not believe we have anything more to discuss. Good day.~
@198   = ~This temple is a symbol of the endurance of mankind in the face of adversity. I will not have you insult my people or my faith again. Try it and I'll crack your blasphemous head against the corner of the nearest building. Believe me, people here wouldn't criticize me for doing it if I told them what you just said. Good day.~
@199   = ~Exactly. That is why we Easthaveners practice the Tempuran faith and perform the rituals of the Lord of Battles.~
@200   = ~Thank you for starting an argument with me. You have proven my point admirably. Good day... idiot.~
@201   = ~We all must seek our own paths through life. I have chosen the path of the warrior, walking in the bloody footsteps of the Lord of Battles. As a woman, it is difficult to do at times, especially since I am a foreigner to this land. The native barbarians do not believe that foreigners understand what "Tempos" really stands for, and they certainly don't believe that women can be his champions or representatives on Toril. Perhaps someday this will change.~
@202   = ~Everard... well, Everard is still adjusting to his position here. I think he'd much rather still be serving Tempus on the front lines, but his duty is to guard this holy site—the site of Jerrod's Stone. You should ask him about it; he knows more of the tale than I do.~
@203   = ~Hello again. Can I help you with something?~
@204   = ~Well, well. It's you again. Why are you bothering me? I have nothing to say to you.~
@205   = ~Well met, Accalia. I'm <GABBER>. You're an initiate in the Tempuran faith, eh? I didn't realize that the Lord of Battles was so popular up here.~
@206   = ~Greetings, Accalia. Rituals, you say? What kind of rituals?~
@207   = ~Well met, Accalia, but I have to go. Farewell.~
@208   = ~Barbarian tribes? How do they feel about the Ten Towns being here?~
@209   = ~And what sense *can* be made out of it all?~
@210   = ~I suppose you could make sense out it, but why not seek a spiritual anchor for hope instead of a gloomy explanation about mankind's warlike nature?~
@211   = ~You said, "We immigrants." Where are you from?~
@212   = ~This is a harsh realm indeed. I must take my leave now. Farewell, Accalia.~
@213   = ~Fists~
@214   = ~Chain Mail~
@215   = ~Medium Shield~
@216   = ~Chain Armor of Darkness~

@222   = ~Aren't ceremonies for the dead more important for the church of Myrkul?~
@223   = ~What local battles do you celebrate?~
@224   = ~What are the "Feast of Heroes" and the "Song for the Fallen"?~
@225   = ~That's interesting. It was nice speaking with you, Accalia, but I must be off. Farewell.~
@226   = ~Sounds like a love-hate relationship. At least they don't try to kill you *all* the time.~
@227   = ~What's this? New face in town, eh? Well met, stranger. The name is Hrothgar, originally of Hillsfar, but now, after years of traveling up, down, and under Faerûn, I am content to call this town my home. Who might you be?~ [HROT_01]
@228   = ~Bah! Some civilized nation should come up here and smash the life out of those impudent barbarians. How do they expect progress to be made? By sitting on the tundra and beating on a stupid drum?~
@229   = ~Well then, welcome to Easthaven, <GABBER>. Whatever your business in these parts might be, I would offer you this small piece of advice: While you're in my town, you'd do well to be on your best behavior. These folk are under my protection, and anyone who would seek to do harm to them in any way shall answer to me.~
@230   = ~I suppose it is their nature to see the immigrants as a threat to their way of life. The tribes' anger is probably more out of cultural isolation than any actual threat.~
@231   = ~Well met, friend. And welcome to my home. Make yourselves comfortable, but try not to break anything. Many of these curiosities that you see lying about have... sentimental value.~ [HROT_04]
@232   = ~Ah, they're all remembrances of my adventuring days, little trinkets and the like that I picked up here and there. More keepsakes than valuables really, leftovers from my days of fortune and glory.~ [HROT_05]
@233   = ~I suppose it is their nature to see the immigrants as a threat to their way of life. The tribes' anger is probably more out of cultural isolation than any actual threat.~
@234   = ~Semi retired, actually. This region is still untamed and fraught with many dangers. I've had plenty of opportunities in the last few years to take up my sword and shield and do battle with those who threaten the safety of Easthaven and its neighbors. In fact, I'm planning such an expedition right now. That is what I wanted to speak to you about.~
@235   = ~Oh, I've seen my share of fortune as well, rest assured. I've beheld more treasure than most kings, I'd wager. But it wasn't for coins that I fought and bled all those years. It was for something grander, more powerful than mere riches. Adventuring is something that is in your blood, not in your purse.~
@236   = ~And well they should. You people treat this land like garbage! Why, this very temple is an affront to the pristine beauty of the Spine of the World.~
@237   = ~You said "us immigrants." Where are you from?~
@238   = ~Brother Gus~
@239   = ~Indeed? Well then, this might interest you. I'm putting together an expedition of sorts, one which would surely provide opportunities for both fortune *and* glory. This is the business I wished to speak to you about.~ [HROT_10]
@240   = ~We've received word from Kuldahar, our neighbors to the south, that evil forces are stirring nearby in the Spine of the World Mountains. I am organizing and leading a party from Easthaven south to Kuldahar Valley to investigate. You look to be capable enough, perhaps you would like to join us. What say you?~
@241   = ~Don't really know. The messenger wasn't too specific. I suppose if you want more details you could ask old Everard over at the temple, but time's a-wasting. We need to get this expedition moving before the snows seal off the pass to Kuldahar. What's it going to be? You in or out?~
@242   = ~This seems to be a dangerous place to live. I must be going now. Farewell.~
@243   = ~Hold a moment—just, just hear me out. Now I've already managed to rally together a few swords for this expedition, but I fear our numbers may not be great enough for the task at hand. I figure that you might tip the balance in our favor.~ [HROT_15]
@244   = ~Well, as you wish. Can't say I'm not disappointed, though. I took you for the adventuring type. Oh well, I suppose you'll make great fishermen, seeing as how that's the only *safe* occupation around these parts.~ [HROT_16]
@245   = ~I agree. Even if we don't like the fact that it's happening, conflict is pretty inevitable in life.~
@246   = ~Excellent! Glad to have you onboard. I plan to assemble the rest of the expedition and set out for Kuldahar within a few days. With storms brewing in the mountains, I'd rather we depart sooner, but there are matters that require my attention here about town.~
@247   = ~What a joke. I can't believe you're actually serious. War isn't vital to our existence. How about things like love and tolerance? How do those fit into Tempus's plan? Some theory you got there.~
@248   = ~Back again I see. Have you reconsidered my offer to join the expedition?~ [HROT_19]
@249   = ~Ho there, friend. Everything is nearly in order. We shall be departing for Kuldahar soon. I suggest you get that supply list over to Pomab before he starts whining. Testy little fellow, that one.~ [HROT_20]
@250   = ~That's something to think about. I must be going now. Farewell.~
@251   = ~There you are! All is set. The others are assembling as we speak. Are you ready to leave as well?~ [HROT_21]
@252   = ~Make haste! I spotted heavy clouds hanging over the mountains this morning. I suspect snow will fall in the passes earlier than normal this season.~ [HROT_22]
@253   = ~Hmm. That seems like a rather empty philosophy. I'd much rather belong to a religion that stands for something of moral significance.~
@254   = ~You do have a point. I suppose I do practice what you preach. The battle between good and evil is as old as Abeir-Toril itself. However, I cannot revere conflict itself. Even if I rely on war to accomplish my goals, I certainly do not cherish the activity.~
@255   = ~A spirited one, eh? I like that. Well, whatever your business in these parts might be, I would offer you this small piece of advice: while you're in my town you'd do well to be on your best behavior. These folk are under my protection, and anyone who would seek to do harm to them in any way shall answer to me.~
@256   = ~That said, I'll let you get back to your cups. I'm sure you've had a long journey, and you'll find there's no better way to shake off the cold of the road than by downing a few mugs of Grisella's best. If you're in need of lodging, I would recommend talking to Quimby over at the Snowdrift Inn over on the east side of town. Once you've had a chance to rest up and get your bearings, come by and see me at my house. It's just a couple doors west of here. There's some business I would discuss with you. Farewell.~
@257   = ~Please. Stay here and relax awhile. I wish I could join you, but there are things that require my attention presently. Come by my house later and we shall talk. Farewell.~ [HROT_28]

@259   = ~What's Everard like?~
@260   = ~Actually, now that I think about it, maybe you can help. Pomab, the local shopkeeper, has recently expressed concern over the rapidly thinning stock of his store. He's been complaining that the regular caravan from Caer-Dineval is long overdue, and that if they don't arrive soon, he's sure to be out of business. Normally, I take Pomab's whining with a grain of salt, but with heavy snows on the way, it'd be best to make sure that caravan makes it through.~
@261   = ~You may not enter the store at this time.~
@262   = ~Interesting. Farewell.~
@263   = ~I see. What local battles do you celebrate?~

@275   = ~I want you to find that caravan. Leave town by way of the south bridge and scout the hills west of Lac Dinneshere—between Easthaven and Caer-Dineval. Caravans always stick close to the shoreline this time of year. Once you find it, see the caravan safely to Easthaven. In the meantime, I'll assemble the rest of the expedition and make the final plans for our journey. Return here as quickly as you can, we must make for Kuldahar Pass while the weather is favorable. Good luck and safe journey.~
@276   = ~Thank you. I must take my leave now. Farewell.~
@277   = ~This is grave news indeed. My only hope is that the town has enough supplies to last us through the winter. In any case, at least we now know for certain what happened to the caravan. Now I can concentrate getting everything in order for our expedition to Kuldahar.~ [HROT_35]
@278   = ~You said "we immigrants." Where are you from?~
@279   = ~Strange, it is not usual for orcs to be so brazen as to attack caravans so close to town. I wonder if it is the anticipation of the coming winter that is driving their actions, or if it is something more. In any case, at least we can still retrieve the supplies, thanks to you. You've proven yourself to be quite capable... I'm glad you've decided to come along with us to Kuldahar.~
@280   = ~It seems almost pointless to live in such harsh conditions. Aren't people afraid?~
@281   = ~We still have preparations to make before we can depart for Kuldahar. Take this list of supplies to Pomab's Emporium across town. While you are there you might outfit yourselves with whatever gear you think you may need. Return here when you are packed and ready to go.~

Unfortunately, all Kresselack could tell us was that neither he nor anyone in the Vale of Shadows was responsible for the evil plaguing Kuldahar.

Unfortunately, all Kresselack could tell me was that neither he nor anyone in the Vale of Shadows was responsible for the evil plaguing Kuldahar. It seems we will need to go back to Arundel and inform him of this. Perhaps he will have a clue as to what we should do next.~

@1745  = ~I suspect that was a story she told you so you wouldn't know she was going on religious retreats. She was a priestess of Auril, and she would head up into the Vale to do the will of her goddess. She... won't be coming back.~
@1746  = ~That was merely a convenient lie she told you so you wouldn't suspect her motives. Obviously, it worked. She was a priestess of that frost-bitch, Auril, and I had to kill her before she did any more of her goddess's work.~

@1754  = ~Very well, then it seems *one* of Kuldahar's problems has been solved, but I suspect Lysan was only a part of a much larger threat.~

@1779  = ~Well, you're in and out of luck. We don't have any rooms, but that pug-nosed knee-high at the Evening Shade, Aldwin, has some rooms for let, if you're interested. Better hope you have enough coin, though... I doubt a pile of gold would be enough for that copper-clenching mole.~
@1780  = ~I... take it you don't like halflings.~

@1784  = ~It's nothing to do with him being half a man—if so, then most of Kuldahar would be guilty. It's his manner; that ill-mannered excuse for a gunny sack came into ownership of that inn recently, and it's a queer thing *how* he did, too.~
@1785  = ~How so?~
@1786  = ~~
@1787  = ~~
@1788  = ~~
@1789  = ~Aldwin and I have discussed this—the truth of the matter is that he came across the previous innkeeper dead in the inn, and then forged the claim. He has admitted his crime, and since Eidan has no relatives, I see no reason to punish Aldwin further.~
@1790  = ~Well, the previous innkeeper, Eidan, is one of the folks who've gone missing of late—thing is, he's one of the only ones that seems to *know* he was going missing, 'cause he left a claim on who to pass the inn onto in case he needed to be put to sleep with a shovel.~
@1791  = ~Go on...~
@1792  = ~Then, barely a day after he's gone, Aldwin shows up like a winter wolf out of the fresh-fallen snow, with the claim in his paws and sets up shop, pretty as you please.~
@1793  = ~Well, Eidan could have just been looking ahead. People leave legacies and wills all the time.~
@1794  = ~Hmmmm. Sounds like he's pulling a swindle... er, not that I would know anything about swindles. Maybe I should poke around the Evening Shade a little, see what I can find. Can you tell me anything else?~
@1795  = ~Sounds like one man's misfortune is another's good fortune. What else do you know about it?~
@1796  = ~Well, I knew Eidan, and the fool was a right enough fellow, but he had the palsy so bad he couldn't even write his own name, much less a claim—and that's even if he *was* in the know about his letters, which he *wasn't*.~
@1797  = ~I see. Interesting. Maybe I'll ask Aldwin about the claim he has. In the meantime, where would I find a meal around here?~
@1798  = ~That is strange. By the way, I'm part of an expedition—from Easthaven, looking for troubles in Kuldahar. I was wondering if you could help me.~
@1799  = ~Thanks, Amelia. You've been very helpful.~
@1800  = ~Hmmmph. Well, we'll see. I don't trust him, I don't. He could have killed Eidan himself, he could've. That little runt better watch himself around here, or I'll use him as a welcome mat.~
@1801  = ~I'm hungry, and a meal would suit me, if the kitchen's still open.~
@1802  = ~I'm part of an expedition—from Easthaven, looking for troubles in Kuldahar. I was wondering if you could help me.~
@1803  = ~Very... well, then. Farewell.~
@1804  = ~If it's a meal you're after, tell that filthy goateed wine-spider squatting behind the bar to stop drinking the stock and fire up the oven. But you'd best shout—he's too deep in his cups to hear you if you talk civilized-like.~
@1805  = ~I may do that—say, I'm part of an expedition—from Easthaven, looking for troubles in Kuldahar. I was wondering if you could help me.~
@1806  = ~I... see. Do you know where I could find a room for the night?~
@1807  = ~Very well, then. I will go speak to the barkeep.~
@1808  = ~Oh, that so? Well, we should all be blessed, then, our bone-carving neighbors trudging through the drifts to make sure we're all right. What's Easthaven worried about us for?~
@1809  = ~We heard of strange events in the region—goblins, orcs, and other humanoids seem to be gathering in Easthaven... and Kuldahar. Do you have any idea why?~
@1810  = ~No, no, I don't—I mean, we've had our share of raiders before, but this year's been worse than any other I can recall.~
@1811  = ~~
@1812  = ~Never mind. I'm more in the mood for a meal than talking at the moment.~
@1813  = ~Do you know where I can find a room for the night?~
@1814  = ~I see. Thanks for the information. I'll let you know if I need anything more.~
@1815  = ~Well, I've heard tell of raiders—goblins and the like—*never* seen in the Pass before. Folks, travelers, have gone missing, and no one knows where. Lots of strange goings-on, got a lot of folks worried. You might want to speak to Arundel—if his beard's any sign, he's got a lot of knowing to his years. You can find him at the base of the great tree—his is the two-storied house to the south and west.~
@1816  = ~I see. Is there any place I could get a meal?~

Calliana also mentioned that another member of the Ilmater clergy, a man by the name of Brother Poquelin, passed through Kuldahar recently from all the way from Cormyr and was going to try and get help from the Monastery of the Weeping Lilac in Bryn Shander.

@2052  = ~We penetrated the inner sanctum of the Temple of the Forgotten God, only to find that someone had gotten there before us. The pedestal that, presumably, had once held the artifact was empty. Bodies lay strewn about the chamber, indicating that the acolytes and their verbeeg guardians had put up a fight in the defense of the gem. Among the bodies was the corpse of a man garbed in the vestments of a priest of Talona. It is difficult to say what part he might have played in the battle or the resulting theft. Perhaps we should return to Arundel and see what sense he can make of all this.~

Aldwin presented a claim that seemed to indicate that Eidan knew he was going away—but according to Amelia, Eidan didn't know how to write, and even if he did, he was stricken with the palsy.

@2328  = ~Crafted in 1021 DR for the warrior Makael the Lean, Turodahel has a bloody military history. Makael was a mercenary who sold his services to anyone with the right amount of coin. Shrewd and crafty by reputation, Makael applied his skills and the power of Turodahel carefully for over three decades. It wasn't until after Makael died of a magical disease that legends about the man started to spring up. It is believed by modern sages that Makael is likely to have killed over five hundred men with his sword over the years. It was widely known that Makael was neither especially strong nor tough. People assumed that it must have been the power of the sword that made his deeds possible. Makael's grave was robbed within a few years of his burial.

For the next few decades, warriors and thieves from all over the Moonsea and Dalelands schemed and murdered to get hold of Makael's legendary sword. One priest of Bane, curious about the sword's powers, stole Makael's skull for divination. When questioned about the magical abilities of the weapon, Makael's spirit answered from beyond the grave with one word, "turodahel." The Banite searched through his books for months before he discovered the origins of the word in a Netherese lexicon. Roughly translated, "turodahel" is a compound noun meaning "the power of discretion."

@2333  = ~Welcome. I've been expecting you for some time now.~ [ARUN_01]

@2335  = ~I am Arundel, known to some as the Archdruid of Kuldahar. Though I invite you to dispense with the formalities and just call me Arundel, plain and simple. Titles tend only to serve one's own vanity and aren't really of much use in this small mountain community.~ [ARUN_03]
@2336  = ~Yes, it was I who sent Hallaster to Easthaven for help. His death weighs heavily upon my conscience, for not only was he a student of mine, but he was also a friend and trusted companion. He will be missed. As will Hrothgar and the other members of your expedition.~ [ARUN_04]
@2337  = ~Oh, yes, I know. I also know that it was no accident. Someone or... *something* did not want your party to reach Kuldahar alive.~ [ARUN_05]
@2338  = ~Let us say I knew *of* him. Word of his deeds has reached even our small, isolated town. I also know that his death, tragic as it is, was no accident. Someone or something did not want your party to reach Kuldahar alive.~ [ARUN_06]
@2339  = ~There are malevolent forces at work in these mountains, forces that seek to undermine the delicate balance we druids have struggled to preserve for centuries.~ [ARUN_07]
@2340  = ~Would that I could. The face of the evil remains hidden, but its presence is unmistakable. All about us, there are signs of its damaging influence on the balance... the unnatural weather, the recent rash of abductions, the numerous monster sightings in the pass. All point toward something sinister. Even the animals sense something is amiss.~
@2341  = ~An evil has come to these mountains. The face of the evil remains hidden, but its presence is unmistakable. All about us, there are signs of its damaging influence on the balance... the unnatural weather, the recent rash of abductions, the numerous monster sightings in the pass. All point toward something sinister. Even the animals sense something is amiss.~
@2342  = ~I can only tell you of what little I know. Which disturbances would you have me speak of?~ [ARUN_12]
@2343  = ~The weather in these mountains has always been harsh, but never like this. Fierce storms ravage the valley without warning, often lasting for several days at a time before vanishing as quickly as they come. It is barely midway into Leafall, and yet the pass to the south has been snowed in entirely. Weather such as this is most unnatural. Nature presents itself in cycles that are predictable by those who know what to look for.~
@2344  = ~Ah yes. Terrible. Terrible. At first, there were tales told by travelers of companions disappearing into the night, snatched up from their bedrolls as they camped along the narrow trail that winds through the pass. We did not think much of these tales, for such occurrences are not unheard of in these mountains. Then one night Conlan's boy, Sheemish, went missing. The next morning, the whole town searched for the boy but turned up nothing. He was just gone. Vanished without a trace.~
@2345  = ~The boy was just the first. Several nights later, another disappeared. Maegan Potts, the local midwife. Her husband Kaleel was grief-stricken to the point of madness. With barely a word to anyone, he snatched up his sword and marched off into the darkness after his wife. No one has heard from him since. And now, the abductions are occurring more frequently. Eidan, the old innkeeper from the Evening Shade, was taken only three days ago.~
@2346  = ~As I'm sure you have noticed by now, there seems to be quite a few goblins about. It is not usual to see so many of their kind roaming the mountains so late in the year. It is almost as something has drawn them out of holes, like carrion birds drawn to the scent of death. As if the goblins weren't enough, several giants have been spotted moving through the pass in groups as large as ten.~
@2347  = ~That many giants traveling together in such numbers indicates they are organized and are acting with a singular purpose. I have watched their activities closely. Their tracks trace a deliberate pattern through the mountains, almost as if they were on patrol. Another thing... while I was out scouting the giants, I discovered other sets of tracks, tracks I have never encountered before. What manner of beast made them... I could not say.~
@2348  = ~*The* balance. It is what the druids of Kuldahar hold sacred and have worked to preserve for generations. It is all around us. It *is* us. Balance is the harmony that is achieved when man and nature learn to coexist, no longer contending with one another, but coming together as two parts of a whole.~
@2349  = ~Balance is the belief that this town is built upon... the very reason for its existence. Druids of Silvanus, the Oak Father, have tended this shrine since the beginning. For hundreds of years, we have striven to achieve the ideal balance between man and nature. When settlers finally came to this pass, it was the Archdruid Tolben, my predecessor, who laid the foundation for the relationship that lead to birth of this community.~
@2350  = ~INACTIVE PROFICIENCY SLOTS~
@2351  = ~INACTIVE SKILLS~
@2352  = ~They erected thorny brambles to keep intruders out, and used their powers to frighten away the men and women that came to build homes in a place they felt was... obviously so close to the gods.~ [ARUN_31]
@2353  = ~It wasn't until the succession of Archdruid Tolben that things changed. Unlike his predecessors, he believed that the settlement of the valley was not only inevitable, but it was actually the will of Silvanus. He also believed that we had been wrong in keeping the settlers away, and that the Oak Father had intended people to share in the miracle of the Great Oak from the beginning.~
@2354  = ~When Tolben finally became Archdruid, he formed a plan to fulfill the destiny of this sacred site by bringing about a union between the Great Oak shrine and the settlers.~ [ARUN_34]
@2355  = ~It was this union that the Archdruid Tolben believed would achieve the harmony that we had been striving for generations... the harmony between man and nature. As it stands, Kuldahar is a monument to this vision. The tree and town exist in a natural symbiosis where it is next to impossible to tell where one leaves off and the other begins. But now the balance is threatened.~
@2356  = ~I fear that if we do not soon discover the source of these disturbances, then all that we have worked for will be destroyed. The evil that has come to these mountains infects this town like a disease. As its people suffer, so does the tree suffer from the sickness that attacks the balance, corrupting it with its very presence.~
@2357  = ~Already, the circle of warmth that radiates from the Great Oak has begun recede. We were forced to abandon the outlying farmsteads as a result of the shrine's fading power. If we do not take action soon, I am afraid that the life-giving warmth will cease altogether. Both the Great Oak and the town nestled within its roots will die. This must not happen. We need your help.~
@2358  = ~I understand, but the circumstances leave you little choice *but* to get involved. I needn't remind you that the avalanche that wiped out your expedition, the one that you were fortunate to survive, has blocked the way back to the Ten Towns. As I mentioned before, the pass south has been entirely snowed-in. There is no other way out of this valley. Your fate and the fate of Kuldahar are intertwined. You *must* discover the source of the disturbances and restore the balance... or we shall all perish together.~
@2359  = ~I suggest you begin by investigating the Vale of Shadows. It is a place not far from here. Darkness has always clung to the floor of the small canyon, as if even the light of the sun were wary of the place. There are a number of ancient crypts hidden within the shadows of the vale's narrow cliff walls. There have been rumors of the dead awakening and emerging from their dusty tombs to walk once more amongst men.~
@2360  = ~If these rumors are true, then I suspect that whatever is responsible for disturbing their slumber may be behind the other disturbances as well. Go to the Vale of Shadows. Learn what you can about the happenings there. Then, return here and we shall discuss a course of action. Good luck and farewell.~
@2361  = ~Please... you must make haste. Time works *against* us. We must discover the source of this evil before the balance is altered irrevocably.~ [ARUN_48]
@2362  = ~Ah, you have returned. What news? Does the evil we seek lie within the Vale of Shadows?~ [ARUN_49]
@2363  = ~~
@2364  = ~Interesting. It is impossible to determine exactly what ails him without examining him myself, but I do know of an herbal remedy that may ease his suffering. If you like, I could tell you the recipe so that you may help him help himself.~ [ARUN_50]
@2365  = ~Tell him to gather a handful of frostberries that grow throughout these mountains. He must squeeze the juices from the berries into a pot of boiling tundra grass. Once mixed, the entire brew must be consumed in order for the pain to subside.~ [ARUN_51]

@2373  = ~I see. What do you intend to do?~ [ARUN_54]
@2374  = ~I understand your position. Typically, such vengeful spirits are not known for keeping their word. But, in this case, I do not think we have much choice. I urge you to reconsider the spirit's offer in order to learn what it knows—at this point, any information is better than none.~ [ARUN_55]
@2375  = ~I understand your position. But perhaps there is more to this priestess than you know. Sometimes, we must choose between the lesser of two evils in order to accomplish good. This is but one of the ways in which balance is maintained. I urge you to reconsider the spirit's offer in order to learn what it knows. At this point, any information is better than none.~
@2376  = ~I understand your position. But perhaps there is more to this priestess than you know.

I urge you to reconsider the spirit's offer in order to learn what it knows. At this point, any information is better than none.~
@2377  = ~Well, if that is what you feel you must do... sometimes, we must choose between the lesser of two evils in order to accomplish good. This is but one of the ways in which balance is maintained.~ [ARUN_60]
@2378  = ~Please... you must make haste. Time works against us. We must have the Heartstone Gem if we are to discover the source of this evil before the balance is altered irrevocably.~ [ARUN_48]

@2387  = ~A fortnights past my former band and I, proud delvers all, were involved in an unpleasant quarrel. We were attempting to abscond an ancient tome for our patron from its resting place. This bickering led to cruel humor, vile words and alas, a lake of bloodshed. The book ne'er made it to our merchant friends hands. His love of wordcraft prevails to this day, and all he wants is his sacred grimoire. So the scuttlebutt is that the pay's handsome and worthy of note—rarecut gems, sacks of loot, odd magics.

@2601  = ~I see. Let me ask you something else.~
@2602  = ~~

@2617  = ~It matters not who sent me here. I need to investigate this tomb. Will you allow it?~

@2625  = ~Then allow me to investigate this tomb fully, Mytos.~

@2629  = ~I don't understand. What is a bone dancer?~
@2630  = ~No. It is forbidden. As a matter of fact, I have spent too much time talking with you and neglecting my duty. I must demand that you surrender the keys in your possession and leave here. I will not ask again.~
@2631  = ~I have no intention of leaving until I am satisfied there is no threat to Kuldahar within these walls.~
@2632  = ~Mytos, I am trying to be reasonable here. I cannot in good conscience leave until I have investigated this tomb fully. Can we come to some understanding?~

@2634  = ~~
@2635  = ~I have no idea. What happens outside this vale is of no concern to me.~

@2639  = ~No. You may not leave here until you have surrendered the keys you have in your possession.~
@2640  = ~I cannot do that at this time.~
@2641  = ~First I must investigate this tomb. Will you allow this?~
@2642  = ~No, we cannot. You have your duty, and I have mine. This conflict was inevitable... Guardians. To arms!~
@2643  = ~So be it.~
@2644  = ~Adequately? Are you trying to imply that you could have done better? I think not.~
@2645  = ~Your creations could not prevent our entry here, Mytos. If they are a reflection of your abilities as a necromancer, then you need more practice in the art.~
@2646  = ~Forgive me. I meant no insult to you, Mytos.~

@2757  = ~Why?~
@2758  = ~Well, he stuck me with this hole and not much business to be had. Winter's choked off all the passes, so that means no caravans and no business. I hope ol' Eidan got buried in a snowdrift or used as a chew bone by an ogre. Hmmph. Anyway, the claim's mine, so I got to make do.~

@2766  = ~Well, Eidan had palsy—but you knew that, right? So if this claim was written to you—of course, assuming that Eidan knew how to write, which he didn't—then the script would hardly be as perfectly written as you say.~
@2767  = ~Just asking. Look, maybe you can help me out—I need a room for the night.~
@2768  = ~~
@2769  = ~~
@2770  = ~Yeah, well, ol' Eidan must have had someone write it FOR him, then, because everything looks in order to me. It's not unheard of to have others write claims for you. All I know is the claim's *mine*. Now do you want a room or not? If not, then *get out*.~
@2771  = ~I may leave in a bit—just one other thing: I found Eidan's ring upstairs.~

@2775  = ~~

@2795  = ~While it's good you didn't hurt Eidan, you *shouldn't* have hid the body and falsified the claim.

Although the priestesses of Auril are naturally resistant to cold and can move through snow and icy rivers with ease, these cloaks amplify the protection of the goddess, allowing the wearer additional cold resistance (which allows a wearer already immune to cold to absorb its power) and even goes so far as to leach the heat from fire attacks directed at the wearer. In addition, the robe may be invoked to allow the wearer to pass over or through any obstacle designed to hold them, such as Web spells, ghoul paralyzation, Hold Person spells, and the like.

This spell turns a creature invisible and makes it undetectable by normal vision or infravision.

The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient talks to or attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if <PRO_HESHE> attacks or casts a spell, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible (although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first).~

His fondness for potions of speed caught up with him when he died of old age four years later. His only heir had no desires to be an adventurer. He sold the weapon to a known cat burglar a few years after his father's death. The sword can be recognized by the kingfisher stamped into the ricasso.

The priests of the god of the dead commissioned and enchanted the sword for a famous halfling adventurer named Eriadon Oakhollow. Eriadon was well known for his fight against those who would defile the tombs of his people. The sword has a dull, even blade with deep engraving on one side. The engraving is in Thorass and lists, in various tables, all of the days of a tenday, months of the year, cycles of the moon, major halfling festivals and observances, and the years of Eriadon's life. The other side of the blade simply features the maker's mark, a black hound's head, and the words "THE SWORD OF DAYS." Tarnished silver in the engraving lines keeps the words and images dark. Upon Eriadon's death, the sword was passed on to a traveling priest of Arvoreen the Defender who is believed to have died fighting goblins in the High Moor.

A rarity in Faerûn, Erion was a man who denied the existence of holy magic and the gods themselves. He was known for his attempts to prove that priests were charlatans and holy magic was, in actuality, a different form of standard magic. Sages believe that Erion's intense opposition to holy men and women actually generated sympathetic magical powers in his weapon. Priests of Selûne in Westgate confiscated the axe when they killed Erion in self-defense. It is currently believed that Erion is one of the unbelievers used as a building block in Myrkul's Bone Castle.

Some believe that the existence of storms and tremors in nature proves that nature is inherently violent.

There is a simple argument against this, however. Nature is a gift from the gods, but it functions as an independent system, a science, if you will. Nature is not inherently violent because disposition towards violence is a property only thinking beings possess. While there are violent acts in nature, nature is not inherently violent. Nature is simply nature..."~
@3189  = ~A tough bartender in Westgate named Righteous Tad commissioned the creation of this weapon to deal with his rowdier patrons. Tad would normally pound the club against the bar if things got out of hand, but he frequently had to join the brawl to restore "order." He is said to have clubbed so many thieves over the head with the stick that no major criminal in Westgate could honestly claim they had never felt Peacekeeper's sting. One such criminal, a thug named Hellpin, took offense at the beating he received. Hellpin trained his dogs on Righteous Tad one foggy night. Tad managed to kill more than half of the canines before he was overborne and done in. Hellpin kept the club as a trophy in his hangout as a warning to those who might cross him.

Fassa the Melancholy (as she is now known) was the head of a band of Selûnite adventurers dedicated to destroying undead wherever they found them. The band was initially quite successful, rarely suffering any casualties. Tymora's luck could not stay with them forever, though.

In 1156, Fassa and her band entered the Sepulcher of the Dim. The band knew the Sepulcher was rumored to contain a "leak" to the Negative Material Plane, but they had no idea just how many undead creations were inside. Mixed in with the seemingly harmless poltergeists and phantoms were powerful specters and wraiths. Over a short and chillingly quiet period of several minutes, almost all of Fassa's allies had their vital energy drained away. Fassa and her remaining companions fled and tried to form a plan of attack. When they returned on the following night, all of Fassa's former companions had been turned into slave specters under the control of the master. She and her few remaining comrades destroyed the master specter and eventually destroyed the souls of her tormented brethren. In the end, Fassa was the only one left alive.

Fassa returned to her temple in misery and prayed to Selûne that she never forget the agony of that night. Selûne granted her request by causing a ghostly white and blue mace to appear on her bed when the next full moon rose. Carved into the shaft of the weapon were two words: Never Forget.

Fassa became almost fanatical in her undead hunting in later years. At the age of thirty-three, tired and bitter, Fassa fell into decline. On the night of a full moon, she renounced her faith to Selûne in front of her superiors and fellow clergy. Hours later, she threw herself into the Moonsea from a high cliff. The mace was found in her room and reluctantly kept in the church. Many years later, the new high priest of the temple decided that the weapon had an unpleasant legacy and should be thrown into the Moonsea. The history of the mace ends with this event.

Unfortunately, these bumbling buffoons haven't spent enough time researching all of the different types of ivy to learn their subtle differences. Why, just the other day, some fool on the hill told me that jangling bell ivy should be planted in relatively moist soil next to blossoming garters. As any ivy scholar worth his weight in dirt knows, blossoming garters require such a huge amount of water that one would drown the jangling bell just by tending to the garters.

"...our principle stance is one of rejection. The fundamental beliefs of the churches of fury are anathema to our own. The Gods of Fury stress everything that is selfish, physically abusive, and destructive. The Malarites care only for proving their temporal power through the senseless butchering of animals. The Aurilites seem to delight in causing death by freezing whenever possible, removing every shred of heat from their domains. Priests of Talos simply revel in destruction for its own sake and their own personal pleasure. Our brothers and sisters in the church of Umberlee cause havoc with the waves for the sole reason of terrifying travelers and fishermen into bowing before their childish god.

Unfortunately for Alerri, Lady Firehair's followers employed charm magic to cease the Banite's antics. Once he had been charmed, Alerri was commanded to perform all sorts of embarrassing actions in the streets of Waterdeep. After many years, Alerri decided to honor his god of hate by creating a suit of armor that would protect him from charm magic. He communed with the spiritual minions of Bane to discover the materials and rituals necessary for the suit's creation. Following his master's instructions, he murdered thirteen married couples and had their wedding rings woven into the hem of the mail. He then killed thirteen elves and bathed in their blood, uttering prayers for thirteen hours. When he was finished, his armor protected him from the magic of the Sunites and filled him with irrepressible hate. Alerri went on a crusade against the agents of Sune, Llira, and Hanali Celanil for three years. His killing spree ended when elven archers and priests of Corellon Larethian laid a trap for him on a road going north from Waterdeep.

The design of the armor is relatively simple: a plain iron helm with a hinged faceplate. Once the basic construction of the helm had been finished, craftsmen would tool the image of a dead warrior onto the faceplate. The name of the warrior and a one-word description of his death were carved into the forehead of the mask. The helm was then left in the dead warrior's funeral pyre. The priests believed that the mask would hide the dead man's fear of the afterlife when he was judged by Tempos. After a month had passed, the helms of particularly valiant warriors were recovered by the priests. Over the next few years, the priests praised the valiant warriors by name in their daily rituals. According to legend, if Tempos found the warrior to be truly valiant, the helm would gain the power to make the wearer immune to fear. This particular helm bears the ancient name "Siglef" and the word "Axe."

Intercession was made for him by an acquaintance, the wizard Peth of Elturel. The weapon itself is rather mundane in appearance, which is exactly how Kelhanion wanted it to look. It has a plain steel blade that meets a similar guard. The grip of the weapon is wrapped in dark, oiled ogre skin.

"The Kraken Society

"Recently established near the Ruins of Ascarle, the Kraken Society is a group of criminal information gatherers spread across the North. Their organization is said to consist mostly of thieves and priests of Umberlee who work for a mysterious overlord. Often referred to as the 'Heralds of the Sea,' the Kraken Society employs torture, kidnappings, and assassination in their efforts to control knowledge. Their symbol is a purple squid with many tentacles."~

The representatives of the human goddess of love and beauty were well received, and the high priestess of Hanali Celanil wore the laurel whenever humans were visiting the Hand. The orcs discarded the laurel as useless trash when they sacked the priests' tower.

It protected its bearers on numerous occasions. The envoys of the Queen of the Sea rarely abused the powers of the device, but it only took one mischievous priest to lose the item. Legends say that Herren of Umberlee used the shield's sanctuary to attack and destroy a number of elementals before the water lord Istishia shifted the priest to the Paraelemental Plane of Ice, where he froze to death. From there, it is believed that the shield floated around the planes for many years, only recently resurfacing in Faerûn.

Considered plain by modern elven standards, the ring was a gift to Kiran-Hai, Circle Singer of Angharradh and Ward Mistress of the Arboreal Tombs in Myth Lahl. The name of its creator has been lost. It is believed to have been stolen from the Arboreal Tombs some time after Myth Lharast fell.

A cult to the Red Knight exists in a few places around Faerûn. The little information that is known about the religion indicates that the Red Knight is a quasi-deity representing strategy and tactics in war. The faith consists entirely of small groups of Tempurans who favor the Red Knight's emphasis of military structure and order. The shield is plain in design and construction, with a small icon of a horse's head carved into the back rim of the item.

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When casting this spell and laying <PRO_HISHER> hand upon a creature, the priest causes 14 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin.

Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal—or can be cured—just as any normal injury.~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell calls upon energy from the Plane of Brilliance and opens a channel between it and the targets. Any evil creatures within the area of effect take 1d6 magic damage for every 2 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of 5d6 at level 10; a successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage. In addition, if victims fail their save, they are blinded for 1 round. This spell cannot be cast by evil-aligned characters.~

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the Invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either with missile, melee weapons or spells, and remain unseen. However, telltale traces—a shimmering—allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus.~

@6077  = ~Then here is what must be done. I need you to find an ancient druidic artifact known as the Heartstone Gem. It is a powerful scrying stone that can be used to divine the location of this evil.~ [ARUN_65]

@6080  = ~Then, one day an initiate of the shrine stole the Heartstone and fled Kuldahar. The young druid had grown impatient with the humble teachings of his mentor, the Archdruid, and hungered for power of his own. He disappeared into the mountains, along with the artifact, and was never heard from again.~ [ARUN_67]
@6081  = ~A few short years after the theft, there were rumors of a strange cult establishing a temple in these mountains. It is conceivable that the rogue druid may have been connected in some way with the emergence of this new cult. If so, then it is possible that the Heartstone Gem may still be found within this temple.~ [ARUN_68]
@6082  = ~The temple is rumored to lie in a canyon far to the east of Kuldahar. I have updated your map to help you find your way. Journey to the temple and discover if the Heartstone is indeed there. If so, return it to Kuldahar and I shall use its power to find the answers we seek.~ [ARUN_69]

Through this spell, the caster imbues <PRO_HIMHER>self with the strength and skill of a Fighter of the same level. The priest's Strength score is set to 18/00—even if it is normally higher—<PRO_HISHER> THAC0 becomes that of a Fighter of the same level, and <PRO_HESHE> gains 1 temporary Hit Point per level. This will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

@6091  = ~Ah, this is terrible news. Did you find any clues as to who these mysterious thieves may be or where they might have taken the Gem?~ [ARUN_72]
@6092  = ~Hmm. The liquid appears to be a form of undiluted snake venom. No doubt this priest of Talona was carrying it for use as a poison. You did well in bringing this to me. This may be just the clue we needed.~ [ARUN_73]
@6093  = ~You see, once extracted, venom such as this tends to lose its potency rather quickly... usually over the course of a few days. So, it follows that this Talonite must have obtained the poison from somewhere within these mountains. There is only one place where poisonous reptiles could thrive in these cold, wind-swept mountains.~ [ARUN_74]
@6094  = ~Dragon's Eye. It is a vast network of caverns that lead deep into the bowels of dormant volcano. The entrance is barely a day's journey from here. I suggest you continue the search for the missing Heartstone Gem there. I shall mark the location for you on your map.~
@6095  = ~Take care. The caverns of Dragon's Eye are fraught with many perils. Tread lightly, and be wary of the creatures that dwell within its depths.~ [ARUN_76]
@6096  = ~Snake bites, you say? Hmm. Did you see any snakes or creatures that could have caused such marks?~ [ARUN_77]
@6097  = ~Hmm. Then the creature must have come from outside the temple... interesting. This may be just the clue we needed.~ [ARUN_78]
@6098  = ~This once-shattered blade lay in the breast of Icasaracht, the last of the white dragon matriarchs that ruled the Spine of the World. It was wielded by Aihonen, a distant ancestor of Jhonen the fisherman in Easthaven—the sword has lain at the bottom of the lake for almost a century, waiting to be returned to one of its wielder's bloodline. How it has been restored to its original state is unknown, but whatever the reason, it looks like a powerful weapon that can help you free Easthaven from Brother Poquelin. 

The blade seems to draw its strength from Lac Dinneshere itself. As long as the wielder is within a dragon's flight distance of the lake, the blade is a fearsome weapon.

@6322  = ~These swords are usually referred to as double-edged swords, war swords, or military swords. In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture and may vary within the same culture depending on the era. Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from thirty-five inches to forty-seven inches. In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

If you are reading this, it means I have met an untimely death. I would tell you not to grieve for me, but I feel much better thinking that you would. There are things I must tell you in this letter that I might have told you before. However, if my death came too soon then I would have never been given the chance. First off, I am not your biological father, for that distinction lies with an entity known as Bhaal. The Bhaal that I speak of is the one you know of as a divinity. In the crisis known as the Time of Troubles, when the gods walked Faerûn, Bhaal was also forced into a mortal shell. He was somehow forewarned of the death that awaited him during this time. For reasons unknown to me, he sought out women of every race and forced himself upon them. Your mother was one of those women, and as you know, she died in childbirth. I had been her friend and on occasion, lover. I felt obligated to raise you as my own. I have always thought of you as my child and I hope you still think of me as your father. You are a special child. The blood of the Gods runs through your veins. If you make use of our extensive library you will find that our founder, Alaundo, has many prophecies concerning the coming of the spawn of Bhaal. There are many who will want to use you for their own purposes. One, a man who calls himself Sarevok, is the worst danger. He has studied here at Candlekeep and thus knows a great deal about your history and who you are.

Your progress in disrupting the flow of iron ore does not go as well as it should. How stupid can you be to allow your kobolds to murder the miners?! With your presence revealed, you should be wary of enemies sent to stop your operation. Your task is a very simple one; if you continue to show that you can't do the job, you will be replaced. I will not send the kobolds you have requested as I need all the troops I possess to stop the flow of iron into this region. With this message I have sent more of the mineral poison that you require. If you have any problems then send a message to my new contact in Beregost. His name is Tranzig, and he'll be staying at Feldpost's inn.

TAZOK~
@6489  = ~[Note for Mulahey 2]My servant Mulahey,
I have sent you the kobolds and mineral poison that you require. Your task is to poison any iron ore that leaves this mine. Don't reveal your presence to the miners or you will find yourself swamped by soldiers from the local Amnish garrison. My superiors have recently hired on the services of the Black talon mercenaries and the Chill. With these soldiers at my disposal, I should be able to destroy any iron caravans entering the region from the south and east. I don't want to deal with iron coming from the Nashkel mines so don't fail in your duty. 

TAZOK
~
@6490  = ~[Note for Tranzig]Tranzig, 
I am perplexed as to why Mulahey has not communicated with us in some while. You are to go to the mines and find out the condition of his operation. You are also to collect any iron that may have been stolen by the kobolds. Our next raid will most likely take place at Peldvale, or Larswood, so visit either of those areas and track us back to our camp.

I have received your request for extra slaves. They will be sent as soon as possible. Events go well in Baldur's Gate. We have purchased one of the western noble estates to use as our base of operations. It is an ancient building, most likely constructed before the erection of the second wall. Its construction makes it very defensible against those who would thieve it. Remember to ask Yeslick if he enjoys his new accommodations.

Our plans go smoothly. Sarevok has arrived from our headquarters in Ordulin. He brings news from our superiors;  they are pleased with our progress so far. I plan to place Sarevok as the commander of our mercenary forces in the region. He has already sent his subordinate, Tazok, to the Wood of Sharp Teeth to take command of the forces located there. Things go apace here in Baldur's Gate. We have placed our first agent among the ranks of the Seven Suns trading coster.

@6493  = ~[Note for Daveaorn 3]Davaeorn,
As you have probably heard, the iron poison has begun to take affect around the coast. With the majority of iron imports being disrupted by Tazok, almost all of it comes from the tainted source in Nashkel. The Sythillisian uprising in Amn has ensured that no forces from that nation will be able to take action against our mercenary forces. However, the Flaming Fist has caught several of the Black Talon mercenaries. All of those captured have claimed allegiance with the Zhentarim and have thus shifted any suspicion away from the Iron Throne. I have sent Tranzig to work with the mercenaries in transporting the iron to your base in Cloakwood. He has brought several bags of holding so that he, alone, will make trips into Cloakwood, thereby lessening the chance that Flaming Fist trackers might find your stronghold.

Its steel and balance are testament to the work of a caring weaponsmith, and the axe's edge is woven with enchantments that allow it to wound even supernatural creatures. Like many weapons of dwarven manufacture, the blade is light, allowing the user to swing the blade more quickly, and the never-dulling edge ensures that the cut is always a clean one. The dwarven runes along the haft spell out the word "Dorn's," no doubt a smith's mark indicating where the weapon was made.

@7282  = ~History of Durpar and Var the Golden:

Durpar and Var the Golden share a common history. Over three-thousand years ago, these countries were both subject to the great kingdom of Raurin. When Raurin fell in 2488 DR, the countries of Durpar and Var barely survived the destruction.

Rioting, mass destruction, and hatred of nobility were rampant, and the two countries descended into barbarism for over two millennia. Finally, after most of the barbarian tribes were wiped out by the great empire of Mulhorand, a leader emerged. Satama, a mere trader, experienced a divine revelation and formulated a new philosophy: All things in the world were connected, were part of a single creation spirit, and all of the gods of the realms were merely parts of the same entity. Soon all the Shining Lands embraced the teachings of Satama, and the seeds of civilization were laid in what came to be known as the Lands of the One.

Since the Lands of the One had many natural resources, trade with Mulhorand and Luiren became a way of life. Merchants were honored above all. In time, the Maharajah of Durpar and the Rajah of Var were replaced with a Council of Merchants. During this time the land suffered occasional raiding attacks from the horsewomen of Dambrath, and had many skirmishes with the neighboring countries of Estagund and Ulgarth.

In 1023 DR, after an armed peace had been worked out with Ulgarth, the council of merchants decided that something needed to done about the raiders from Estagund who were hurting trade with other countries. War was an inconvenience, but interrupting trade was life-threatening.

Jeradeem, the richest merchant in the lands, was given power to negotiate a settlement. During these negotiations he proved, at least in the eyes of the Durparians, that he was indeed the master trader he seemed. Estagund had just tried a foolish invasion of Dambrath. The vengeful female leaders of that land wiped out nearly every able-bodied fighting man they sent. The monsters of Veldorn were causing problems, and Estagund was going through a famine.

It was here that Jeradeem showed his fine merchant's instincts. He could not pass up such an advantage, and began bargaining the most outrageous trade of all time. He met with the leaders of Estagund, a fearful king and his nobles, and explained the advantages of Durparian life and the philosophy of the Adama, the oneness of all things. He bargained for days until finally the king made the trade. He purchased the whole of Estagund for the countries of Durpar and Var at the price of 24 gems. He also promised protection, and help for their integration into the Durparian way of life. Thus were formed the Shining Lands.

Within a hundred years, the three countries shared a common way of life, and with the added strength and resources of Estagund, Durparian merchants increased their trading range. They roamed as far east as Kara-Tur, as far north as the Sea of Fallen Stars, and west to Dambrath and Halruaa. At the present time, with the newly discovered lands of Maztica and Zakhara beckoning, the future looks bright.~
@7283  = ~History of Tethyr:

For the past 1500 years, Tethyr has had a single, strong royal family ruling with absolute power. When a king died or became incapacitated, his oldest son took the throne. As the family trees of those close to power became more intertwined and complicated, there were the inevitable wars of succession and bickering over which second cousin was the "true" heir to the throne. Civil wars were brief, however, and once the fighting was over the system returned to normal (until the next major dispute in a few hundred years or so).

The established reoccurring cycle was broken 10 years ago. The current ruling family had been in power for over 350 years, so long that they had dropped their own family name centuries ago (no one even remembers it now) and simply called themselves Tethyr. King Alemander IV was comfortably ruling from Castle Tethyr, and the country seemed happy enough, but there was a broad current of dissatisfaction among the people of Tethyr. Non-humans were forbidden by law to own land, and since most rights and privileges accorded citizens were based on land ownership, they became second-class citizens as well. Things were especially bad for elves, who were driven deep into the Forest of Tethir by royal armies. Alemander IV took land away from rightful owners and gave it to nobles who promised larger contributions to the royal treasury. These social and economic inequities, coupled with several harsh winters and bad harvests in a row, made the time ripe for a change.

It takes more than just a couple of lousy winters to depose a king however; It takes treachery as well. In the case of the fall of House Tethyr it took an ambitious general and impatient royal heir. Prince Alemander grew tired of waiting for the robust Alemander IV to make room for him, so he struck a deal with General Nashram Sharboneth, commander of the king's largest army. While Sharboneth marched his army toward Tethyr, bringing along a sizable group of angry peasants recruited with the promise of land reform, the would-be Alemander V downplayed alarming reports from the king's spies and advisors, silencing the most persistent permanently through murder or exile. By the time Sharboneth's army arrived and laid siege to Castle Tethyr, it was too late for loyalists to help.

As Sharboneth launched a direct assault on the castle (using the expendable peasants as shock troops), a handful of elite soldiers let in a secret entrance by the prince would eliminate key guards and open the gates. At the same time, the prince (one of the few people allowed to see the king directly) would murder his father. A fire set by the elite troops would destroy the evidence of treachery and the general and the prince would emerge from the conflagration and announce a new, joint government.

The plan was executed perfectly, but only up to a point. Sharboneth double-crossed the prince; his men were much too efficient in setting the castle ablaze, and Prince Alemander (along with most of his fellow conspirators) died horribly in the fire. At about the same time, a spy planted on the general's inner staff by the equally duplicitous Alemander murdered the general and dissolved his body with a powerful acid before anyone could come to his aid.

To make matters worse, everyone had underestimated the resentment the people felt for the royal family. Once Castle Tethyr began to fall, there was no holding back the mob. In one night, the proudest, strongest castle in all the country was reduced to a smoking ruin. Everything of value—fine tapestries, plates and silverware, furniture, jewelry, weapons, clothes, armor, paintings, statues, etc.- was either stolen, burned, or just ripped apart and stomped into the dust.

As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos. In what is now known as the "Ten Black Days of Eleint," anyone known (or even suspected) of blood connection to the royal family was put to the sword. This led to some darkly humorous moments, as social climbers who had bragged just a week before of being a sixth cousin twice removed of a royal aunt tried in vain to convince an angry mob that they were "only kidding."

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack, and some baronial keeps fell. Local leaders who had adequately distanced themselves from the Tethyr family, or were popular enough (or feared/strong enough), survived. These surviving nobles became the initial players in the fight to decide the fate of Tethyr.

One thing was certain; any leader or type of government that too closely resembled rule under the Tethyrs would not be accepted. "Royalist" became a dirty word in Tethyr society. The power struggle continues to this day, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon.~
@7284  = ~History of Amn: 

Amn has the good fortune to have abundant natural resources; some would say Amn is the richest land on the continent. This has worked in Amn's favor for generations, because even if they were conquered, the new masters would be gentle, looking to gain wealth from the land, rather than to put it to the torch. 

Amn has been a center of trade and commerce for as long as anyone can remember. Oral traditions handed down from father to son tend to support the theory that Amn has been a trade center for at least 800 years. Unfortunately, written records are difficult to find and often incomplete. It would seem the typical Amnish citizen was too busy trying to fill their coffers to write down events of the day. 

Amn has always been more interested in the present and the future than the past, and this makes an accurate history difficult. The best records, the business papers of the oldest trading companies, are jealously guarded. The fear of revealing "trade secrets" is stronger than the call of history, so the average citizen knows very little about Amn's past. 

It appears that the Amn of 100 years ago was very much like the Calimshan of today. Each major city was basically an independent entity, banding together for defense when necessary, and fighting for control of territory and profitable trade routes the rest of the time. A particularly brutal trade war began 24 years ago, with each city exacting prohibitive tariffs on goods imported from the others. The trade war escalated, and city troops began to raid caravans sponsored by other cities. In a matter of months commerce was brought to a halt, a number of cities were under siege, and war threatened to engulf the entire region. 

Into the breach stepped a young merchant named Thayze Selemchant. Thayze was smart, charismatic, and very well connected (the Selemchant trading house was one of the oldest and richest in Athkatla.) He secretly contacted representatives of the five other richest merchant houses in Amn, and started to plan. 

The first part of the plan involved the careful sprinkling of rumors about outside threats. One involved a pirate invasion from the Nelanther, another was about a massing of orcs just on the other side of the Cloud Peaks. Thayze even started a rumor about an elf army in the Forest of Tethir, ready to pounce on a divided Amn. None of the rumors were true, but they began to turn people's thoughts toward unity, not war. 

Thayze knew that if he and the other members of his council were to take control of Amn, they would need broad-based popular support. Tensions between cities and merchant houses were still high, so to get that support, Selemchant and the others agreed to drop their family names and never use them again. 

When news of a "Council of Six" spread throughout the land, many people accepted their rule. A group that would unite Amn under one rule, governing for the benefit of all instead of one city or trading company over another, was indeed a welcome change. The Council raised an army (at great personal expense) to quell the few pockets of resistance that remained, and have been in total control of Amn for the past 22 years.

@7285  = ~History of Calimshan:

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air.

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire. Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinni and efreeti started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there. Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old.

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places—Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr—took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe.

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change. As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born. It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calishite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the realms. Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn. The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere.

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim. A force that great they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the realms, and that didn't happen. Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir).

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to solely dominate the land. There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its own power over its own area. About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land. Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do. The oldest son of each pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one. The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over 18 years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan 44 years ago.~
@7286  = ~History of Estagund:

Estagund history follows a different path than those of Durpar and Var. The Gunders were conquered in 551 DR by Reinhar I, warchief of the Arkaiuns of Dambrath. It regained its independence when Reinhar was slain by the Halruaan archmage Mycontil, though the country soon degenerated into a group of small independent city states.

Skirmishes with Var, and between the city-states, continued for several centuries until a king once again united the country. King Bornial was a skilled ruler, and under him Estagund began to prosper. His descendants did not share his wisdom, and in 1053 DR, King Selkarin more than illustrated this. He had failed to conquer Durpar, and Veldorn resisted his challenges. An avowed misogynist, Selkarin turned his attentions to the matriarchy of Dambrath. He led a large fleet to attack Dambrath, taking extreme losses, including his own life. Selkarin died childless, so his brother Seltarir was crowned King. The new ruler faced a country with most of its fighting men gone, and an unforeseen problem: famine. The famine was caused by a blight that wiped out nearly all the year's crops in Estagund. This made him eager for a deal posed by the Durparian merchant Jeradeem, and in a legendary trade the entire country of Estagund was sold. Contrary to popular rumor, Seltarir did not trade away the country for 24 pearls. In actuality he received diamonds worth almost a million gold pieces. The sudden wealth gave him an instant seat on the council of merchants, so he retained a measure of rule in addition to his fortune. Chaka Seltarir is still the richest chaka in Estagund to this day. In the years that followed, the Gunders began rebuilding their lives under their new circumstance, and now they compete on equal footing with the merchants of Durpar and Var.~
@7287  = ~History of Gondegal the Lost King: 

Arabel, long under the dominion of Cormyr, for a time became the center of a swordsman's empire. This swordsman was Gondegal, the Lost King, who in the Year of the Dragon (1352 DR) attempted to carve a kingdom for himself centered on Arabel. it was to extend north to the Desertsmouth Mountains; south and west of Wyernwater and the farms outlying from Eveningstar; and east to Tilver's Gap and the mountain passes. 

In the years following, people would say that Gondegal's reach was no longer than his blade. He could not hold any of the territory against the might of Cormyr, Sembia, Daggerdale, Tilverton, and several of the other Dales -all of whom he drew the blood and ire of in the making of his throne. 

Gondegal ruled for less than a season, though he reigned officially for scarcely eight days. The remainder of his rule was spent fighting here and there against one foe or another in the lands he claimed. His troops were largely mercenary, and his treasury of seized goods was small and soon gone. One night Gondegal's force simply melted away before the advancing troops of Cormyr, and was gone. King Azoun IV retook Arabel on that morn without wetting a blade. 

No one has ever found the body of Gondegal; he is known to have fled north and then east via Teshwave, but then his fate becomes a matter of conflicting rumor and legend. Some believe he still lives with a score or more of loyal followers, keeping court in the wilds somewhere, a careful and ruthless bandit who takes care that none survive his attacks to carry tales anywhere. When entire caravans vanish at times anywhere between the High Dale and far-off Impiltur, he is blamed by talk in the taverns. 

Gondegal was said to be a tall, gray-haired warrior of considerable personal skill and intelligence. His badge was a gray wolf's head, face on, with red eyes. Caraban guards often warn merchants to beef up the escort on a particular caravan, " else thy gold'll soon be gilding Gondegal's throne." Gondegal was an impeccable swordsman and somewhat chaotic in his self professed neutral alignment. If he does indeed yet live, the magic or treasure he carries, and who his allies might be, are all unknown.

Gondegal's reign had a great influence on the King of Cormyr, at that time in his second decade of rule. Not only was Azoun forced to put down an effective rebellion in his own country, he was forced to pay more attention to matters outside Suzail, to become the ruler of a nation as opposed to a city-state. Further, the bloodless assault on Arabel was Azoun's first true experience at the head of his army, and the joy of "freeing" the people of Arabel is one that remains with him.

@7288  = ~History of the Chosen of Mystra: 

The reason why Mystra, the Goddess of Magic, invested a portion of her divine might in mortals is not known. One of the more popular theories, and one that is gaining more support in light of the goddess's other actions during that period, is that Mystra foresaw the Time of Troubles (and her own passing at the hands of Helm) and chose to give some of her power to mortals in order to ensure that her successor (the female mage Midnight, as it turned out) would have a number of nearly immortal allies in the struggle against the schemes of the gods (the now dead Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal) who precipitated the Time of Troubles by stealing the Tablets of Fate. The theory goes on to suggest that Mystra informed Azuth at approximately the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR), more than 1,300 years before the Time of Troubles, that some of her power must be put into the hands of mortals who would then become known as Mystra's Chosen. This power would sleep within the bodies of those mortals, allowing Mystra to call on it only with their permission. It would give the Chosen the innate ability to heal quickly, and would give them life spans far greater than those of ordinary mortals. Mystra speculated that these mortals might be able to call on her power and thereby gain some special abilities, but that these powers would not rival those of a deity. (See "Powers" below.) 

The Goddess of All Magic then began to select mortals she thought to be suitable. One of the first was the young mage Elminster, and she also singled out a promising wizard named Khelben Arunsun. Both have proved to be worthy and capable receptacles of her power, but Mystra's other early attempts to invest her power in living humans were unsuccessful, and she came to realize that only very few mortals were of stern enough substance to contain such power within themselves without being destroyed or corrupted. Even though some people aside from Elminster and Khelben may have possessed the requisite strength, it is possible that having lived for years prior to being visited by Mystra had set them on a path from which they were not able to deviate. Whatever the reason, the problem needed to be solved. To get around the difficulty, Mystra devised a plan to use herself as a vessel to breed individuals who could be nurtured and acclimated to her power from the very beginnings of their lives. 

For the father of these individuals, she picked the best example of human stock she could find: Domal Silverhand, a nobleman and a former Harper who lived near Neverwinter. Mystra then possessed the body of Elue Shundar, a half-elven sorceress whom Dornal was already attracted to. Mystra revealed her presence and her plan to Elue, who happily and eagerly agreed to have the goddess share her body. Elue had been reluctant, but under the influence of Mystra the woman became a seductress, and Domal found his advances being suddenly returned with great fervor. 

Dornal and Mystra/Elue were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR). The first of seven daughters, Anastra Sylune, was born the following winter. Sylune's six sisters emerged at one-year intervals thereafter: Endue Alustriel, Ambara Dove, Ethena Astorma (she prefers the shortened "Storm" these days), Anamanue Laeral, Alassra Shentrantra (known today as the Simbul), and Er'sseae Qilue. These siblings have become known in Realmsian lore as the Seven Sisters. 

Domal, who had been kept in the dark about his wife's true nature through the years (presumably because Mystra didn't want to risk losing his services), was disappointed and nearly distraught by the time his sixth child was born; He had always wanted sons as well as daughters. More importantly, he was seeing his wife deteriorate right before his eyes. The strain of coexisting with the goddess all these years had turned Elue into a withered shell—in essence a lich, clinging to life only because Mystra's power was within her. 

When Elue was carrying the seventh child, Dornal consulted a priest who told him his wife had been possessed by an entity of great magical power. To spare both of them any further agony, he attempted to slay his wife's physical form by severing her head from her body. 

As soon as he had done this, Mystra was forced to reveal herself to him, and she went on to explain her scheme. Just as she had worried would happen, Dornal was aghast at how he and his wife had been used by the goddess. He turned his back on the corpse of his wife, abandoned his lands and his children, and vanished into the North. Mystra bore him no ill will, and in fact protected him for the final 30 years of his life. When Domal finally did meet his end he called out to Mystra, and the goddess granted him continued existence as her servant. Now known as the Watcher, Domal Silverhand travels the world unseen by mortals on a continuing mission to locate candidates to swell the ranks of the Chosen and to identify possible threats to Mystra and her minions.~
@7289  = ~History of Shadowdale—The Fall, of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshal of the Twisted Tower:

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors. The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home. The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below. The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshal of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days. Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege. With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; However, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun. Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people. Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow. Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives.~
@7290  = ~History of Shadowdale—Ashaba Becomes First Lord of Shadowdale:

Upon taking the Twisted Tower and removing the drowish yoke from the people, the Dalesmen had fully established the Dale of Shadowdale, with its seat of power in the tower itself. Its first lord was a water wizard who had aided in the final attack;  Ashaba, who was great in age when he ascended, and ruled peacefully for 40 years thereafter. It is said that Ashaba realized he was dying and turned himself to water, merging with the river. Since that time, the river, the ford, and the Twisted Tower all bear his name. Before passing on Ashaba chose one of his trusted lieutenants as the new lord of Shadowdale. Presented to the people of the Dale, he was made the new lord by acclamation. In an additional honor, the pendant worn by Ashaba was thereafter recognized as a symbol of the lordship in the Dalelands, and was possessed by each of the successive lords following.~
@7291  = ~History of Shadowdale— Joadath and the Tyrist Massacre: 

The past hundred years have been an example of the best and worst of the lords of Shadowdale. All have been nonnative to the Dalelands, though all made the land their home. A century ago the lord of the Dales was one Joadath, a stiff-necked agnostic who denied the power of any god, good or evil, and used force to back up his beliefs. During this time there was a great deal of religious persecution, including a massacre of Tyrists on Watcher's Knoll. Joadath was eventually killed by a beast of the nether planes summoned by parties unknown, which then proceeded to rampage through the Dale. The beast was killed and Shadowdale rescued by the spellcasters Aumry and Sylune. Aumry was proclaimed lord by acclamation.
~
@7292  = ~History of Shadowdale—Aumry Rules in Peace:

The longest period of peaceful rule was by Lord Aumry and his wife Sylune (better known as the Witch of Shadowdale). They ruled over the community for forty years, a period of extended peace with their neighboring dales, nations, and the elven peoples. It was this very peace and power which made the Dale the target for attacks and sabotage by the Black Network (Zhentarim). They sought (and still seek) to control the trade from the Moonsea to the Sword Coast, and desired to make Shadowdale a vassal state of Zhentil Keep. Lord Aumry's rule ended tragically when he was assassinated by Zhentish agents.~
@7293  = ~History of Shadowdale— Jyordhan the False Lord: 

 Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan. Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand(the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people. It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse. 

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale. His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network. When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule. Sylune, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule.
~
@7294  = ~History of Shadowdale— Khelben Kills Jyordhan: 

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff. The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died. In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him. In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales. Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed. Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne.~
@7295  = ~History of Shadowdale—Lords Accepted by Acclamation: 

This acclamation of the people has formed the basis for choosing the lord of Shadowdale since the routing of the evil Lord Jyordhan by Khelben Blackstaff. Usually a predecessor will step down as opposed to dying in office, and his chosen successor will be approved by the populace at large. This system has had its drawbacks, as will be shown below, but in general, it has served the independent, self-willed people of the Dale very well. They have avoided the "genetic lottery of which good bureaucracies and bad kingships are made" (a quote from the venerable Elminster). The symbol of the lordship is the Pendant of Ashaba, a device owned by the original wizard, and used to determine the rightful lord of the Dale.
~
@7296  = ~History of Shadowdale—The Time of No Lords:

During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords. Sylune and an adventuring company known as Manes' Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area. The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following it's abandonment by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader. With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures.~
@7297  = ~History of Shadowdale—Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale: 

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates. They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale. Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship. It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well. 

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network. He also reinstituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal. Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people. The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender. Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there is little validity to the claim.~
@7298  = ~History of Shadowdale—Elminster Moves to Shadowdale: 

It is of note that during the time that Doust Sulwood of the Knights of Myth Drannor assumed the role of Lord of Shadowdale, Elminster took up residence in the area. A semi-regular visitor up to that time, he took possession of a low, abandoned tower at the foot of the Old Skull, and declared himself to be officially in retirement. The nature of that retirement varies from active involvement in local affairs to long-term vacations on other planes. The natives of the Dale have come to the understanding that they cannot always count on the powerful mage being in residence in times of need or danger, but when he is present in these circumstances his aid is usually given.
~
@7299  = ~History of Shadowdale—Doust Chooses Mourngrym Amcathra to Succeed Him:

Doust Sulwood, recommended to the position by Khelben Blackstaff, ruled Shadowdale as lord for five years. "Seems like a millennium," he was oft known to have reported, and the tedium of court life and the lure of adventure eventually caused him to retire his position and rejoin the Knights of Myth Drannor in regular adventuring. He handed the Pendant of Ashaba (symbol of the Lordship) on to one of the younger Knights, a Waterdhavian noble named Mourngrym Amcathra. Mourngrym had been dispatched by Khelben from Waterdeep for other purposes, but Doust liked both the young man's straightforward honesty and his willingness to shoulder the burden of protecting the small community from myriad dangers. Time has proven this choice a wise one.~
@7300  = ~History of Shadowdale—Shaerl and Mourngrym Meet and Marry: 

The implications of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun "choosing" the last two lords of Shadowdale (Doust Sulwood and Mourngrym Amcathra) were not lost on the Dale's powerful neighbor to the south, Cormyr. An agent was sent northward to divine Mourngrym's true intentions and to guarantee the Dale's continued good relationship with the throne of the Purple Dragon. The agent was a rogue named Shaerl Rowanmantle, sent by Vangerdahast (though all paperwork on this matter has been curiously incinerated in Suzail, so all is hearsay and tale). Shaerl discovered more than she intended and fell in love with young Mourngrym. The two married and became the lord and lady of Shadowdale. Shaerl's loyalty is now to her husband and to the land they co-rule. This was probably not the intention of the Cormyreans.
~
@7301  = ~History of Shadowdale— Mourngrym's Rule:

Since being recommended to the position by outgoing Lord Doust Sulwood, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra's rule of Shadowdale has been less peaceful than he had hoped. The First Battle of Shadowdale occurred in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), and involved Daleland forces routing those of Lyran the Pretender. Lyran has made repeated attempts to gain the Lordship, as was intended by the former Zhentish puppet, Lord Jyordhan. While significant, this battle pales when compared to the larger battle fought on the same site between Bane-led Zhentil Keep forces and the Dales during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR). When the Battle of Shadowdale is referred to (without a number), it usually means this second battle. In addition, Mourngrym has had to deal with a large number of skirmishes, incursions, a possible invasion from below, explosions, and other sundry disasters. 

Mourngrym and Shaerl have one child, Scotti, who is now nine winters old. By the customs of the area, he is not considered the heir apparent, and another suitable warrior or mage may take the reins of power of the small community. Most feel that Mourngrym will hold the Pendant until his son has reached his majority, then abdicate in young Scotti's favor once he takes his grown name. If this happens, it will be the first occasion of the lordship of Shadowdale passing down through a family.
~
@7302  = ~History of the North—The First Flowering: 

For millennia, gold elves dwelt in Illefarn (where Waterdeep now stands) and Eaerlann (along the River Shining). From their ornate forest cities, they traded with emerging human nations like Netheril and Illusk and repulsed the attacks of the goblin races. Meanwhile, dwarven clans united as the nation of Delzoun, named for the dwarf who forged the union. The nation, existing primarily underground, extended from the Ice Mountains to the Nether Mountains. Silver Moon Pass was its western border and the Narrow Sea its eastern shore. Orcs came from north of the Spine of the World but were turned back in great slaughter by the elves. To this day, this is the homeland and stronghold for orcs and similar races.~
@7303  = ~History of the North—The Crown Wars: 

Humans immigrated in bands from the Shining Sea and up to the Sword Coast. They became seafarers, striking out across the waves to the Moonshaes, Mintarn, Ruathym, and the northern islands. Elves engaged in an unceasing war against each other, with the humans and orcs taking over the resulting ruins. Perhaps the greatest calamity to befall the Fair Folk was the Dark Disaster, a killing magic that took the form of a dark, burning cloud. It enshrouded the kingdom of Miyeritar, and when it faded away some months later, not an elf lived—nor were trees left, only an open, blasted moor: the High Moor. 

All was not dark for the elves. Although in retreat, as barbarian humans and orc hordes grew in strength, their power rose in the Elven Court and Evereska (remaining a stronghold to this day). They conceived of cooperation between dwarves, kindly humans, and other elves for mutual survival against orcs, marauding humans, and the tide of beasts (ogres, bugbears, trolls, goblins, gnolls, and other nonhuman creatures) led by the rising power of giants. Astonishingly, in at least three places—the Fallen Kingdoms and the cities of Silverymoon and Myth Drannor—they succeeded with shining grace. 

To the east, on the sandy shores of the calm and shining Narrow Sea, human fishing villages grew into small towns and then joined together as the nation of Netheril. Sages believe the fishing towns were unified by a powerful human wizard who had discovered a book of great magic power that had survived from the Days of Thunder—a book that legend calls the Nether Scrolls. Under this nameless wizard and those who followed, Netheril rose in power and glory, becoming both the first human land in the North and the most powerful. Some say this discovery marked the birth of human wizardry, since before then, mankind had only shamans and witch doctors. For over three thousand years, Netheril dominated the North, but even its legendary wizards were unable to stop their final doom.~
@7304  = ~History of the Bell in the Depths:

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands. Northkeep was of great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command or the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races, however these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers. The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep—its slender, now-broken spires—can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby. This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands. On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.~
@7305  = ~History of the Red Ravens:

One of the few long-standing mercenary companies that operate in Cormyr, the Rad Ravens have a strength on paper of 110 swords, but can easily triple that number with new hires if they get a sufficiently large contract. They have been kept on retainer by the government of Cormyr with the stated purpose of cleaning out the Stonelands to the north. They have been moderately successful in this goal, but the Stonelands are still far from being a safe territory.

The Red Ravens are commanded by Rayanna the Rose, a veteran of the Horde crusade. They are noted for their honesty and trustworthiness, as they don not wish to jeopardize their royal charter. Most of their troops are armed with studded leather and carry long swords. They charge 200 gold pieces per week for the services of their 110-being unit. Their symbol is a red raven amulet.~
@7306  = ~History of Dambrath:

The nation of Dambrath was formed out of a barbarian kingdom almost a half-millennium ago by a powerful alliance of priestesses of Loviatar and the drow from the city of T'lindhet.

In 211 DR, fleeing from the destruction of the homeland by the then-great kingdoms of Unther and Mulhorand, four tribes of barbarians entered Dambrath. They found a coast where the dolphins danced and plains where the grass was long. They roamed from the borders of the Walls of Halruaa as far east as the current borders of Estagund. They soon became known as the Arkaiun, or people of the wind.

In 545 DR a great warchief, Reinhar, arose to lead the tribes. The halflings of Luiren were quickly enslaved, and several of the coastal cities of Durpar were captured or razed. Estagund fell to his rule, and eventually Reinhar turned his attention to Halruaa.

An army of 40,000 horsemen and a fleet of 50 ships mounted a coordinated attack, and even though Reinhar was able to get beyond the Walls of Halruaa and occupy the cities of Mithel, Galdel, and Zalsuu, their magics proved to be more than a match for the invaders. Reinhar was finally defeated in a great battle at Sulaziir by the archmage Mycontil and his troop of wizards.

Reinhar's son, Reinhar II, took command of the army and set out on a two month overland retreat. He arrived home with a thousand surviving fighting men and no shaman. Reinhar II proved to be as good a ruler in defeat as his father was in war. He consolidated his forces and pulled home almost all of his troops, as he knew that the defeat made them tempting prey for raiders and encroaching monsters. This action allowed for the safe development of his peoples.

By the time the ninth Reinhar was king in 802 DR, the Arkaiuns were fat and lazy. Reinhar IX, or Reinhar the Foolish as he is more commonly known, insisted on expanding his nation to gain more gold to finance his military campaigns. He ordered the mining of many rich lodes of silver and electrum in the Gnollwatch mountains, but before his plans of expansion could begin, the miners encountered the drow of T'lindher. The drow were outraged and began a steady series of raids and attacks on the Arkaiun strongholds. Whole villages were destroyed overnight, and no trace of the invaders could be found.

Reinhar IX committed the foolhardy action of attacking the drow in retaliation. While the Arkaiuns managed to get a force into the drow city, this action only succeeded in uniting the normally chaotic drow. For once, the full power of a drow city was turned against an enemy.

The battle quickly moved back to the surface. Reinhar's raiders were wiped out, leaving Reinhar with only a small portion of his original military. This was not enough for the drow, who demanded total enslavement of the entire surface nation. The Arkaiuns resisted valiantly, and the war went on for three decades at tremendous cost in life to both sides.

Finally, the drow had the Arkaiun forces cornered at Malduir. Almost without hope, the defenders were overjoyed when a group of half-elven pilgrims appeared on the scene. The high priestess, Cathtyr Shintar, offered the aid of her clerics to help defend the city, and Reinhar took this to be an omen from the gods. A priestess was placed with almost every company.

Within a tenday the drow struck. The priestesses did indeed prove to be of great aid, but to the drow. Every priestess turned on the Arkaiuns, and Cathtyr herself slew Reinhar. The drow were still weakened by the battle, and only the presence of the priestesses enabled them to win. Cathtyr, realizing the unique advantage she possessed, made a deal that ever the suspicious drow embraced. Her priestesses would rule the land, and in exchange they would provide access to the surface for the drow, trading weapons, slaves, and supplies.

The drow were delighted with this brazen offer from a surface dweller. Reinhar had been slain and the insult avenged, and after 30 years of war the drow were not particularly interested in Dambrath. They did insist, however, on taking the best captured males as slaves. Cathtyr quickly agreed to this, seeing the males as an obstacle to her own power.

Cathtyr ruled for 205 years. She fulfilled her promise to make Dambrath, or " The Nation of Pain," a bastion of evil in the realms. In her time, Cathtyr saw the priesthood of Loviatar expand to thousands, and faith in the Beastlords previously worshiped by the Arkaiuns was nearly eradicated. Many of the Arkaiuns were able to escape their new mistresses, and flee to the Swagdar. There they resumed their almost forgotten nomadic life.

The priestesses of Loviatar continued to enjoy good relations with the drow, and some even took mates, creating a race of drow half-elves. These dark half-elves became known as the Crintri, or "noble ones." Most are priestesses of Loviatar, though many are mages as well. They consolidated their power, learning much of the area from the Shebali, or "lower ones," as the Arkaiuns are now called. The capital of Dambrath was established at Cathtyr, built after Cathtyr's passing and named in her honor. Her death came at the hands of her daughter, Filina, who had grown tired of waiting for her mother to die. Filina ruled for only five years, however, before her own daughter, Cathakay, assumed the throne in the same fashion. Cathakay ruled for 54 years, eventually falling in battle against a gold dragon. She died childless, and here niece Melanith assumed the throne.

Melanith faced an increasing population, and unrest among males who longed for a return to their prestige of old. Melanith did not return their previous status, but she did make use of them. Fearing that the great nations of Mulhorand and Unther might rise again, she decided that mundane tasks, such as defense of the kingdom, would be handled by men. She was the first to name a male to the post of warchief. Sadalar, a Crintri, became the queen's consort. His term as warchief was characterized by widespread bribery and corruption. He was, however, responsible for getting many privileges returned to the Arkaiuns. After Melanith's rule, the Shebali were considered second class citizens, rather than slaves.

Though males were granted more power during her rule, Melanith also solidified the split bewteen the sexes. While the rulers of Dambarth had been females for over two centuries, it was more because of competence than gender. Melanith, however, decreed that men could have no authority except over other men. The female-led hierarchy of Loviatar was quick to back this move.

Many of the bravest and best men of the kingdom perished in raids on Estagund, Durpar, the bandit tribes of Veldorn, and against the gnolls that had returned to the Gnollwatch mountains. Some even fought at the side of the drow in their battle with the svirfneblin city of Aventine. The deep gnomes were destroyed, but so were the Shebali. The drow and the Crintri were largely unharmed, and for their aid, the Crintri were rewarded with a number of drow males to breed in to their race. Melanith took a drow male as her consort to replace Sadalar, who had perished in the conflict. The drow, Nym Inthigg, fathered three daughters and a son. It was at this time that Melantih began the isolationist policy that Dambrath still follows today.

Melanith ruled for 156 years; her daughter Ausitil for 125. The current queen of Dambrath Yenandra, who is known in Dambarth as the "Pirate Queen," is said to have sailed as far south as Zakhara on pillaging raids. Yenandra has been ruling for 71 years, and is beginning to show signs of age. She has three daughters as well, named Luatharyn, Meltruil, and Hasafir. While she does remain extremely popular, especially to the Crintri, the children of leaders in this land are not known to patiently wait their turn.~
@7307  = ~History of Luiren, Land of the Halflings: 

The halflings of Luiren claim that it is the original homeland of halflings in the realms. Although other halflings may disagree with this, it is true that Luiren was settled hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago. 

Luiren's history is one of conquerors and subjugation. Throughout the centuries, the halflings have been conquered by the barbarians who used to inhabit Dambrath, by the kingdom of Estagund, and even once by the monsters of Beldorn. In every case, the invaders were eventually defeated because they made the mistake of underestimating the halflings due to their small stature. A good bit of mischief, mayhem, and general trouble-making by the halflings also helped end the occupations.

Currently, Luiren is enjoying unprecedented prosperity. The halflings are currently taking advantage of their relationship with the nation of Durpar; their biggest customer and greatest competitor. Also, through these close ties with Durpar, Luiren has protected itself against another Dambraii invasion. The rulers of Dambrath must know that if they begin to expand to the east, they will arouse the ire of Durpar, as well as Var and Estagund. The threat of a trade embargo and/or military consequences have kept this aggressive nation away from the Luireners.~
@7308  = ~History of Halruaa:

Halruaa was settled centuries ago by wizards fleeing the Phaerimm in what was to become the Anauroch desert. The first wizards came in unique flying ships invented by the Netherese, and found a beautiful and rich country settled only by shepherds and large herds of aurochs and wild rothe. It was here that the wizards decided to make a stand, should the Phaerimm follow. The Phaerimm never did, but Halruaa has had to defend itself from attacks by all of its neighbors since then.

Over the centuries, Dambrath has attacked and raided Halruaa's ports and borders multiple times. Once, led by a magic-resistant barbarian, the Dambraii occupied all of the country south of Lake Halruaa. They were defeated in battle by the great archmage Mycontil, who slew their barbarian leader. Forty thousand Dambraii attacked, and were stopped by five hundred Halruaans. More than two hundred Halruaan wizards, including Mycontil, died in the battle.

The last attack upon Halruaa was less than one hundred years ago, through the Telath Pass by the power-hungry king of Lapaliiya. He had allied with bandits from the wastes, though this time the Halruaans were able to field a larger force, including fighting men as well as wizards in their skyships. The attackers were easily routed.

Halruaa also suffered through a civil war about five centuries ago, when a number of mages advocated beginning new experiments in magic, ones which even the Netherese didn't approve of. The renegades were driven from the region, but went on to found the land of Thay, or so it is said in Halruaa.

Since then, Halruaa has been at peace (they have had no declared wars), though it still suffers raids from Dambraii pirates, bandits of the wastes, savages from the Mhair Jungles, and any other pirate, raider, or hungry wizard who thinks that magic and wealth grow on trees in Halruaa.

This constant raiding has made the Halruaans very defensive, warlike, and traditional. The people say that since wizards have always led them, wizards always will.~
@7309  = ~History of the North—Recent History of the North: 

In the waning summer months of 1367, an immense orc horde descended from the Spine of the World, intent on winding its way south into the trade lands of the North. This force of orcs, led by King Greneire, surged its way south between the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, stopping just outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. 

King Obould, orc ruler of the Citadel of Many Arrows, was terrified at the prospect of another orc horde, despite the fact that he knew they should be working together against the humans of the North and the spawn of Hellgate Keep. His tribal shamans, however, had been predicting a treacherous fall of the citadel—and they'd told the king that he'd be disposed by other orcs. 

Thus, it was a dark day when King Greneire and his horde of 150,000 orcs appeared on the plains outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. King Obould announced to his followers that this horde had been sent to dislodge them from their home and send them out to be scavengers among the plains. He vowed that, as Gruumsh as his witness, the Citadel of Many Arrows would slaughter these treacherous orcs "like elves during a festival." 

For four months, the 40,000 orcs within the citadel held their ground. Assault after assault was mounted against the high walls of the garrison, but the attacking orcs were losing far more than the defenders. Still, the living conditions within the walls—never too good to begin with—created losses of their own. 

The battle for the Citadel of Many Arrows culminated during the first week of Uktar. As another light blanket of snow sought to bury the gathered orcs, King Greneire threw his entire remaining army at the citadel, bursting its gates and pitting orc against orc in a flurry of swords. As the two orc kings sought one another out along the ramparts, the citadel began to burn. 

The orcs that survive the battle still speak of the superhuman prowess of the two kings as they battled one another before their troops. Finally, however, King Obould ran Greneire through with his long sword, but Obould was severely wounded by the time Greneire had breathed his last breath. The orcs erupted into battle once again, and no one is quite certain what became of King Obould. 

It was through the smoke and snow that the victors of the conflict emerged: the dwarves of Clan Warcrown along with a contingent of troops from Silverymoon. Charging in through the shattered gates, these new attackers quickly routed the exhausted orcs of the citadel, sending them scurrying off into the wilderness. 

King Emerus Warcrown now rules the Citadel of Many Arrows, though the dwarves now call the city by its old name of Felbarr. Most in the North still tend to refer to the city as the Citadel, however, waiting to see if it can withstand the next orc horde. King Warcrown has put out a call for all dwarves to help defend the citadel, and news of a new vein of gold and silver is spreading rapidly through dwarven communities.

@7310  = ~History of the North—The Elven Exodus:

This era left behind elven strongholds ripe for pillaging by humans and orcs. When elves chose to leave the North and travel to Evermeet, their works quickly disappeared, leaving only places like the Old Road and a ruined port in the High Forest to mark Eaerlann's passing. And yet it was not only the elves who would disappear from their long-held homes; the human nation of Netheril also stood on the brink of history.

Doom for Netheril came in the form of a desert, devouring the Narrow Sea and spreading to fill its banks with dry dust and blowing sand. Legend states that when the great wizards of Netheril realized their land was lost, they abandoned it and their countrymen, fleeing to all corners of the world and taking the secrets of wizardry with them. More likely, this was a slow migration that began three thousand years ago and reached its conclusion fifteen hundred years later.

Whatever the truth, wizards no longer dwelled in Netheril. To the north, the once-majestic dwarven stronghold of Delzoun fell upon hard days. Then the orcs struck. Orcs have always been foes in the North, surging out of their holes every few tens of generations when their normal haunts can no longer support their burgeoning numbers. This time they charged out of their caverns in the Spine of the World, poured out of abandoned mines in the Graypeaks, screamed out of lost dwarfholds in the Ice Mountains, raged forth from crypt complexes in the Nether Mountains, and stormed upward from the bowels of the High Moon Mountains. Never before or since has there been such an outpouring of orcs. Delzoun crumbled before this onslaught and was driven in on itself. Netheril, without its wizards, was wiped from the face of history. The Eaerlann elves alone withstood the onslaught and, with the aid of the treants of Turlang and other unnamed allies, were able to stave off the final days of their land for yet a few centuries more.

In the east, Eaerlann built the fortress of Ascalhorn and turned it over to refugees from Netheril as Netherese followers built the town of Karse in the High Forest. The fleeing Netherese founded Llorkh and Loudwater. Others wandered the mountains, hills, and moors north and west of the High Forest, becoming ancestors of the Uthgardt and founders of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar.~
@7311  = ~History of the North—The Spread of Humankind:

The adaptable humans made use of magic they could seize or learn from the Proud Peoples to defeat all enemies, breaking (for a time) the power of giants and orcs. Waterdeep was founded. The last of the pureblood elves died out, a result of continued marriages with humans.

In the far west, men also dwelled—wise, clever primitives called the Ice Hunters. They lived simple lives on the coast since time beyond reckoning, countless generations before Netheril's first founders set foot on the Narrow Sea's western shore. Yet this peaceful folk fell prey to another invasion from the south: crude longships that carried a tall, fair-haired, warlike race who displaced the Ice Hunters from their ancestral lands.

This race, known as the Northmen, spread farms and villages along the coast from the banks of the Winding Water to the gorges of the Mirar. Northmen warriors drove the simple Ice Hunters farther and farther north, forced the goblinkin back into their mountain haunts, and instigated the last Council of Illefarn. Within five hundred years of the Northmen's arrival, Illefarn was no more—its residents had migrated to Evermeet.

From the Coast, Northmen sailed westward, claiming and establishing colonies on the major western islands of Ruathym and Gundarlun, eventually spreading to all the islands in the northern sea. Others migrated northward, past the Spine of the World, and became the truly savage barbarians of Icewind Dale.

In the centuries that followed, Ascalhorn became Hellgate Keep when it fell into the hands of fiends, and Eaerlann collapsed under the attack of a new orc horde. The elves fled southeast, joining with Northmen, Netherese descendants, and dwarves to form what would later be known as the Fallen Kingdom. This realm was short-lived and collapsed under the next orcish invasion—though in dying, it dealt the goblin races a blow from which they have yet to recover.~
@7312  = ~History of the North—The Might of Men:

Along the coast, in what was once the elven community of Illefarn, humanity was once again rising in power. Merchants from the south, tribesmen from the North, and seafarers from western islands had created a village around a trading post on a deep-water harbor, first known as Nimoar's Hold after the Uthgardt chieftain whose tribe seized and fortified the ramshackle village. Nimoar and his successors, known as War Lords, led the men of Waterdeep (as it had become known to ship captains) in a slowly losing battle against the trolls. In a final, climactic battle, the trolls breached the aging palisade and all seemed lost—until the magic of Ahghairon of Silverymoon turned luck against the trolls, destroying and scattering them.

Ahghairon, heir to the heritage and learning of Netheril, stayed in Waterdeep, and in his 112th year he again saved the city—this time from itself. In so doing, he created the Lords of Waterdeep. The city grew into the greatest in the North, possibly in all Faerûn, With Waterdeep as a firm anchor, civilization forged cautiously into the wilderness. Illuskan (now Luskan) was taken from the orcs. Loudwater, Llorkh, Triboar, Longsaddle, Secomber, and other towns were settled by pioneers from Waterdeep, sponsored by Waterdhavian merchant families.

Though it's been centuries since the last orc invasion, 'there's still constant strife. Barbarians harass merchants, travelers, and towns; the seas swim with Northmen pirates; and wars have marred the land in recent years. Luskan, now a fierce merchant city known to harbor—and support—pirates, waged a war with the island realm of Ruathym over an act of piracy against one of the few legitimate Luskan merchant ships. The war raged for nearly a year, with Ruathym slowly losing ground. When it appeared Luskan would finally win the naval war and land on the island itself, the Lords' Alliance entered the fray. They threatened war against Luskan if the skirmishes didn't stop immediately. Unable to fight a two-front war efficiently, Luskan canceled its invasion plans.

Tensions between Luskan and Ruathym are still high, and their ships are often seen taking potshots at each other as they pass, often just a wave or two away from each other. The government of Ruathym has recently been sending adventurers into the hills of its island realm, looking for mercenaries who are killing merchants, farmers, and woodsmen. Ruathym believes Luskan still has a presence on the island, trying to win through subversion and terrorism what it could not accomplish through war.

To the far north, the Ten Towns have finished rebuilding after being nearly destroyed by the monstrous forces of Akar Kessel. With help from the tundra barbarians living nearby, they've built and repaired their cities, replanted the sparse foliage, and—most importantly—replenished the morale of their citizens. A recent trader who passed through the area carrying 17 wagons of rare oak lumber said that it was nearly impossible to determine who's a barbarian and who isn't. "They're living together!" he reported in amazement.~
@7313  = ~History of the North—1368, Year of the Banner: 

 As the dwarves settled in for the winter in their reclaimed city of Felbarr, a group of Zhentarim-sponsored adventurers broke into Great Worm Cavern, slaying Elrem the Wise, shaman leader of the Great Worm tribe, as the tribe's warriors descended into the ranks of the evil adventurers, teleportation magic spirited at least three of those responsible—as well as a vast amount of treasure stolen from Elrem—to safety. 

According to Themrin, the tribe's present shaman, Elrem promised to "watch over the tribe in spirit now that my mortal form is destroyed." Despite the reassuring words of Elrem, the tribe suffered through an oppressive winter that included both heavy snow, scarce game, and low morale. 

Trusted visitors to the barbarian encampment report that Themrin and Gweshen "Ironhand" Talistars are wearing some form of armor made from the scales of Elrem. This use of their former shaman's body as "protection" was supposedly ordained through a dream vision. The armor appears as little more than a supple leather armor, but seems to deflect blows and protect as well as full plate mail. 

Nesme reported a drastic rise in the number of troll attacks in the Evermoors, and various sources confirm that something is driving the trolls out of the moors. Whatever is behind the trolls' exodus is destined to remain a mystery for the remainder of the year, as adventuring parties expend themselves against the never-ending supply of trolls that are fleeing the bog. 

In the most surprising move of the year, the Blue Bear Tribe, led by the shaman/chieftain Tanta Hagara, marched on the fiend-ridden fortress of Hellgate Keep. While a brief struggle for political 'control of the city was reported by various sources, Tanta Hagara emerged as the new ruler of the city.
~
@7314  = ~History of the North—1369, Year of the Gauntlet:

The tumultuous climate of Hellgate Keep continued to provide adventuring activity. A group of Harpers infiltrated the city using cloaking magic and revealed that Tanta Hagara was actually an annis. This revelation did nothing to hamper the Blue Bear's respect for their powerful chieftain however, and 'the city responded to the unmasking by attacking caravans en route to Sundabar. In addition, a few expeditionary forces of tanar'ri were sent to harass the Citadel of the Mists, Sundabar, and Silverymoon. Tanta Hagara informed her "loyal troops" that gates existed in these cities that could allow other tanar'ri to "join us in the glorious battles to come as we take control of all of the North!"

Alustriel cast powerful magical spells in the defense of Silverymoon against the raiding tanar'ri, and the city itself suffered no damage from their attack. The Mistmaster of the Citadel of the Mists likewise aided in the defense of his citadel, though reports still rage about the assistance of the treants of the High Forest.

Sundabar suffered from Hellgate Keep's attack, as the fiends broke through the walls and raised havoc along the city streets. While adventurers battled the fiends, Helm Dwarffriend led a large contingent of the city guard to drive the remainder from Sundabar. Still, the fiends from Hellgate Keep left the city with 'the satisfaction of knowing that it was burning in their wake. Within two days, however, the fires were extinguished, and Sundabar has since rebuilt from the attack.

By mid Eleasias, rumors that Turlang, the powerful treant who resides in the northern High Forest, was actively defending the woodlands near the Citadel of the Mists reached the ears of Tanta Hagara, the hag-ruler of Hellgate Keep. News that Turlang was aiding the Mistmaster did not escape her notice, and the belief that the Citadel of the Mists was holding an extra-planar artifact only added to the hag's interest.

Tanta assembled a large force consisting of more than 100 tanar'ri and other fiends as well as 500 members of the Blue Bear tribe to raze the Citadel of the Mists. But as the evil forces marched their way into the High Forest, the Mistmaster put his own plan into motion. Two Harper agents, a bard named Cryshana Fireglen and a priest of Mystra known as Spellviper, infiltrated Hellgate Keep disguised as members of the Blue Bear tribe. Each carried with them part of an extra-planar artifact called the Gatekeeper's Crystal.

The Gatekeeper's Crystal is an artifact shaped like a three-pointed star that is made of onyx and an unknown metal that entwines itself through the gem. Each point of the star is a separate piece that can be combined together to create the artifact or separated to form three powerful magical items. While the crystal can be used in different manners, it was primarily created to bring down wards, including mythals and other powerful protections. According to legend, it was created by a powerful lich who used it to render clerics powerless, stripping them of their ability to turn undead and nullifying necromantic magic within a 50-mile radius.

The Mistmaster had a different use for the Gatekeeper's Crystal, but he needed volunteers to aid him in placing two shards of the crystal at precise locations within the warded city of Hellgate Keep. In particular, he needed two people who would be willing to trade their lives to exterminate the fiends of Hellgate Keep forever. Spellviper and Cryshana agreed to the suicide mission, Holding the pieces of the crystal, the two Harpers waited for the Mistmaster to activate the magic with his third piece, initiating the magic that would tear Hellgate Keep asunder. When a blazing beam of purple energy illuminated the skies over the keep, no one within the fiend's stronghold had time to wonder what was happening.

The power of the Gatekeeper's Crystal forced the wards to cascade upon the city, causing an implosion that shook the ground for more than 100 miles. As quickly as the wards surrounding Hellgate Keep collapsed, the crystal released the magical energy in an explosion that leveled every building in the city, leaving nothing but fist-sized chunks of rocks where Hellgate Keep once stood. Not a living creature stirred in the remains; all was silent and lifeless.

The force of tanar'ri from Hellgate Keep was unsure what had happened but had felt the tremor when the Gatekeeper's Crystal had been activated. They were fighting for their own lives, however, as the treants, korred, centaurs, satyrs, dryads, and other creatures of the High Forest—including defenders of the Citadel of the Mists—battered them into the moist earth. One of the North's most notable rulers fell in the battle, however, but he took at least six tanar'ri with him to his grave. Faurael Blackhammer, the lord protector of Triboar, fell along- side his troops near the conclusion of the conflict.

Within weeks after the final battle with Hellgate Keep, treants blocked passage farther north at the joining of the Heart-blood and Delimbiyr rivers. While the treants care little for hunters and adventurers passing through the area, all caravans seeking passage north to Sundabar have been repulsed—and this is not a matter that the treants wish to negotiate.

In another mishap blamed on Turlang, Tumstone Pass was blocked by a tremendous avalanche. This final calamity sealed the Upvale from any major force of men. Travel into the area formerly occupied by Hellgate Keep is now limited to adventurers and other brave travelers.

The Mistmaster has been questioned repeatedly by some of the most powerful wizards in the realms, including Elminster of Shadowdale and Khelben Arunsun, about the current location of the Gatekeeper's Crystal. Most sources claim that the pieces of the crystal have been scattered amongst the planes again, but no one is certain.

Near Nesme, the source of the trolls' exodus is revealed. Fog and cloud giants have taken up residence in the moor, driving the trolls from the giants' new "homeland." While its unknown how many giants have taken up residence in the High Moor, estimates range up to several hundred. A thick mist continually hangs in the air of the Evermoors now, even more persistent and thick than the mist before the giants' arrival. Many believe that these new mists are the work of the cloud giants, but none can be certain.

Alustriel of Silverymoon sent a detachment of guards to investigate the eastern borders of the moor, and the guards returned with news that a gathering of around 20 fog giants who were "of good nature and quite friendly" had taken up residence in a formerly troll-infested area.

Guards from neighboring Nesme were not so fortunate, however, running into a clan of violent, boulder-hurling fog and cloud giants who nearly decimated their unit. In addition, a group of adventurers crawled into Nesme with terrible burns, reporting that they had run into a black dragon at a fog giant encampment. Overall, it appears that both good and evil giants now call the moor their home.~
@7315  = ~History of the North—Return of the Beast (1367—?): 

Sages, philosophers, historians, and priests alike feel an ill-boding in the chill air. They predict a slow change over the next decade, but within the lifetime of men born on the first day of this age. They believe that the beasts that once ruled the land plan to return to claim what's rightfully theirs, imprisoning and enslaving the crowns. Where elves once reigned, men now rule, but their hold—as true for all civilizations before—is tenuous at best.
~
@7316  = ~History of the North—1370, Year of the Tankard: 

Even before spring has graced the Savage North, reports of treants massing in the High Forest have reached all of the northern cities. It seems that all of the creatures of the forest have mobilized to restore the High Forest after the fall of Hellgate Keep. Something must still reside below the ruins of Hellgate Keep, however, for the Company of the Jaded Heart never emerged from the depths below the city. The treants have since blocked entrance into the ruins, sealing whatever evil still lurks within far below the sight of man. 

But there is other activity in the North as well. Luskan still flirts with war, tempting neighboring cities and yet staying just below the wrath of Waterdeep. The barbarians still brew in the north, easy to take offense at innocent incursions into their sacred holdings. Rumors of Zhentarim agents scouring the Fallen Lands for powerful magic from long-lost Netheril continue to circulate. And adventurers still abound in the Savage Frontier.
~
@7317  = ~History of Waterdeep: 

Waterdeep was used as a trading site for trade activities between northern tribesmen and southern merchants more than two millennia ago. By 1,000 years ago, permanent farms had sprung up in the area. The first mention of a Waterdeep (not as a city, but as a collection of warlords) occurs only 400 years ago. The city was truly established as a going concern by 1032 DR, the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep, and the date from which Northreckoning is counted. The city grew spectacularly, such that by 1248 DR both the City of the Dead and the guilds had been developed. The guildmasters seized control soon afterwards, ushering in a period of unrest and bitter conflict known as the Guildwars. The Guildwars ended only when the two surviving guildmasters brought in their own period of misrule. It was only in 1273 DR that the present system of government (or lack thereof was instituted. This was the year that the Magisters were established and the secret Lords of Waterdeep were firmly reestablished. Since that time, the city has continued to grow and prosper. Humankind and other races come from all over the realms to earn hard coin in the City of Splendors. Over the years these successful merchants have set up guilds and themselves become nobility, supporting the secretive Lords of Waterdeep who police the city fairly, yet with a light hand, by means of the superb city guard (soldiers), city watch (police), and over 20 black-robed magistrates. As a result, Waterdeep is a place tolerant of different races, religions, and lifestyles. This in turn has encouraged commerce, and Waterdeep has grown into a huge, eclectic city.
~
@7318  = ~History of the Dales and the Elven Court:

The founding of the Dalelands long preceded the creation of any of the existing Dales by hundreds of years, and the year numbering system known as Dalereckoning is actually a commemoration of humankind being given permission to settle in the lands north and west of the Inner Sea. Most of the current Dales are relative newcomers, the older having been abandoned, destroyed, or overrun long ago. In those ancient days, when Suzail and Chondathan (now called Saerloon) were mere coastal trading posts, the elves who ruled this forest entertained a request from settlers from the East; refugees and farmers from far-off Impiltur and Damara. This request was to farm and settle the borders of the great forest Cormanthor, in particular the rich delves and dales along the rivers Arkhen and Ashaba. These newcomers did not wish to lumber or clear the inhabited forest, but only to settle on the rich territories on its edges, and unlike some other settlers (early Sembia comes to mind) were willing to ask permission.

The lords of the Elven Court granted that request in return for aid from these new Dalelanders against outside aggression, both monstrous (orcs and goblins from the lands of Thar) and human (the rising powers in Cormyr and Sembia). In commemoration of this pact, humans and elves raised the Standing Stone that is now seen where the Moonsea Ride reaches Rauthauvyr's Road, the road from Essembra to Hillsfar. It is from the date of the raising of this stone that Dalereckoning is counted. According to the pact made, the Dalesmen would only settle those regions that were unforested or unclaimed by the elves. As the elven woods receded under the axes of further invaders and settlers, old Dales perished and new ones came into being along the borders of the woods. People, both good and bad, have raised petty nations in the Dalelands since, though any one Dale that turned against the pact would have to deal with the others. Each of the Dales is a large swath of farms and fields, with a few scattered settlements and usually one central marketplace, capital, or Dale center. These centers are often, but not always, named after the Dales they are in, adding to the confusion as to what is a Dalelands territory.

The Dales are not city-states, for their largest groupings of population rate as towns at best, and they lack the defensive walls common throughout the Heartlands. They are neither true nations in the fashion of Cormyr or Sembia, and occupy a gray middle ground wherein they are nothing more, or less, than Dales.

Each Dale has slightly different laws, customs, and military organizations. Many rely on the work of charismatic heroes and adventuring companies for aid in times of trouble, and a large number of these individuals use the region as a base. This attraction for adventurers is further increased by the large number of elven and pre-elven ruins in the area and the departure of the Elven Court for Evermeet, leaving the woods open for exploration and exploitation.

The history of the Dales is filled with battles and attacks on its various members. In the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Scardale, under the command of Lashan Aumersair, launched a number of swift attacks, conquering a number of the surrounding Dales. A coalition of forces from the others, as well as Sembia, Cormyr, and Zhentil Keep crushed the invaders and occupied Scardale. During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR), Shadowdale was attacked by Zhentil Keep. More recently, the Dalelands have committed forces to a unified army under King Azoun IV of Cormyr to turn back the Tuigan Invasion (1360 DR).~
@7319  = ~History of Cormyr: 

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses and the line of its kings. For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts. At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne. King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line. 

The land has been officially at peace for many years—since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders. However, Cormyrean armies have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, recently mustering its forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel; to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands; and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading from the east. One wit has noted that "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy." In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling orcs and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap. Both of these areas are threatened by raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton. Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West. '
~
@7320  = ~History of Sembia:

The land of Sembia was settled by humans coming to the Sea of Fallen Stars from the south, and was originally chosen for its stands of huge, high-quality iliyr-wood timber so prized in shipbuilding. However, as the forests were cleared over the years, the treecutters came into increasing conflict with elves who feared the loss of their entire wood. This would undoubtedly have occurred, had not the hastily gathered mercenary troops of the fledgling land been defeated by the elves at Singing Arrows (884 DR). This battle convinced distant Chondath to abandon its holdings in the region and allow the immigrant Sembians to establish their independence (though as little more than a collection of rival city-states, much like the Moonsea or Vast of today). It also set the stage for the appearance of the Raven.

The young country grew strong as farms prospered in the newly cleared lands. Craftsmen arrived from the south to take advantage of this chance to acquire land and wealth, bringing their trades with them. Rauthauvyr the Raven unified the city-states and towns in the face of the continuing "elven menace," and insisted on maintaining a standing army, which he kept in practice by policing Sembia's borders and improving its roads. At this time (913 DR), Sembia became as a true nation.

The Moonsea's (Dragon Sea's) mineral wealth was discovered by humankind at about this time, and pressure began to grow for a trade road through the elven woods to make Sembia the world's gateway to all these riches. The Raven went alone as an envoy to the Elven Court and asked the elders of their Council to approve a road open to humans linking Sembia to the shores of the Dragon Sea (an earlier road had been destroyed during the conflict and was now overgrown). Raven proposed that the elves choose the route and retain control of it and the woods around it, so that no woodcutting or human settlement would occur. The elves had earlier made similar arrangements with the Dalesmen and had no difficulty with the concept of such an agreement. However, the inhabitants of Velarsdale (now Harrowdale) refused the proposal, not wanting or needing such a road at that time (curious, since later a ruler of Harrowdale commissioned the disastrous Halfaxe Trail). The elves, not wishing to offend long-time allies, refused Raven's request.

Rebuffed, the Raven then threatened to exterminate the isolated elves in Amothoi, the last embattled remnant of the elves in Sembia, if the Elven Court did not cooperate. If the road was built, however, they would be free to trade, or not trade, as they wished. The elves agreed under this pressure, and Sembia's financial future was secured. Hillsfar, on the shores of the Dragon Sea, became a commercial meeting ground between humankind and elves, as did Elventree. The route the elves chose ran past the base of the Standing Stone as a reminder of earlier, less-hostile dealings between humans and elves. Over the years the elves of Amothoi came north to join their brethren or slipped away to seek Evermeet, leaving their wood to gradually disappear.

Sembia grew rich under merchant leaders of increasing wisdom, such as Saer (for whom Saerb was named) and Selgar (for whom Chancelgaunt was renamed as Selgaunt). Before his death, Rauthauvyr the Raven saw that these merchants had a strong standing council of merchant elders to advise them and to ensure that no ruler could hold onto power by force of arms. Then this farsighted man, creator of a nation, now half-blind and infirm from old war wounds, rode north into the elven woods and disappeared. None know what happened to him or where his bones lie, save perhaps some few elder elves.~
@7321  = ~History of the Moonsea: 

The Moonsea has a long history as the border between the elven lands to the south and the darker, more sinister lands of the Ride and Thar, home of dragons and giant and ogre tribes in great multitudes. The deep sea was an excellent barrier to the raiders, as those tribes who sought invasion had to detour around and through the lands that would eventually hold Yulash, Zhentil Keep, and Hillsfar. 

The first true settlement in Moonsea was Northkeep, a shining citadel established as a beacon of civilization and a jumping-off point for merchants seeking trade with the dwarves of the North—including not only Tethyamar, but the clans of the Cold Lands—who traded their metalwork and craft for much-needed magic. In the end, Northkeep was sunk beneath the icy waters of the Moonsea by the inhuman forces, and humankind suffered one of many setbacks in the region. 

So has been the nature of human habitation of this region since the beginning. Human settlements thrive for a few years, usually through sheer willpower and on the strength of a sharp sword, and then are overrun by goblins, orcs, dragons, beholders, or giants. Phlan has fallen and risen again. Yulash is a ruin where a decade ago there was a thriving town. Hulburg and Sulasspryn are empty hulks. Each of the cities of the Moonsea seems threatened with extinction in its turn, then is rebuilt. 

This cycle may be the reason that only the strongest and the most savage survive, even prosper, in the lands of the Moonsea. The greatest cities—Hillsfar, Mulmaster, and the impenetrable Zhentil Keep—are all ruled by evil people who control their lands with iron grips. The lesser cities, Elventree, Phlan, and Thentia, may be less evil, but have a strong, independent, almost chaotic nature. In many ways the Moonsea is a frontier, with a frontier mentality.

@7322  = ~History of the Vast: 

Two millennia ago the Vast was Vastar, the orcish lands. These were the breeding grounds of the goblin hordes that would spill eastward and cross the Dragon Reach in ramshackle boats to raid the elves. The orcs were overthrown by invading dwarves, who established the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. It was during this time that the first humans came to the Vast, including the mage Maskyr. 

The rule of the dwarves occurred against a backdrop of constant war with the orcs, such that there were perhaps only 40 years of true peace for the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. The orcs overran the dwarves, and they escaped extinction only through the aid of human and elven allies. The remaining dwarves left the region to the newly arriving humans and retreated to the east, to the south, and to isolated and hidden communities within the Vast. 

The most successful of the humans were the adventurers whose hunger was sated by gold and whose thirst was slaked by great deeds. This was the Time of the Glorious Fools, and there are those who will argue that it is still that age, as adventurers still rule the cities of Calaunt and Ravens Bluff. The orcs today are contained, if not conquered, and trade has grown up in the lands of the Vast. However, for many individuals with adventuring blood, it is still a wilderness in which one may prove one's worth.~
@7323  = ~History of the Dragon Coast: 

The history of the Dragon Coast is the history of money, particularly the darker side of the coin. Situated on the main trade routes between the Inner Sea and the Sword Coast, these lands never coalesced into a solid, coherent nation, like Cormyr or Sembia. Instead small petty city-states have risen and fallen, powered by greed and the most powerful merchant or pirate faction of the day. 

As a result, the Dragon Coast has always been the home of the smuggler, the pirate, the rogue, and the hired killer. It has been the place where those seeking to skirt the laws of more civilized nations to the north make landfall. It is here that the Red Wizards gain their access to the Western Heartlands, and where the Cult of the Dragon launches its plots to the south. And it is here that independent secret societies and assassin guilds have their greatest power. 

The last semblance of organized resistance to this trend was the reign of Verovan, last of the kings of Westgate. The monarchy of Westgate had long worked closely with the various mercantile and pirate factions, but Verovan attempted to stem the growing power of the merchant houses and petty lords. His sudden and mysterious death without acceptable heirs in 1248 DR opened the door for much of what now is commonplace in the Dragon Coast—corruption and treachery. 

It should be noted that while Verovan's name is still venerated in these lands, better known is Immurk, the greatest of the Inner Sea Pirates, a brash and flamboyant rogue who united a pirate fleet beneath him and ruled from 1164 DR to his death in 1201 DR. Such it is in the Dragon Coast, that good people are venerated, but the power of darker rogues is imitated.
~
@7324  = ~History of the Western Heartlands:

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked—Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day.

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade, and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land—freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces, or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.~
@7325  = ~History of the Zhentarim, Two Zhents' Worth: 

Much confusion exists in the realms regarding Zhentil Keep and the (not-so) secret society known as the Black Network or Zhentarim. The two are closely tied, such that a speaker may refer to one when meaning the other and still be clearly understood. In general, both mean trouble.

Zhentil Keep is a walled independent city on the western shores of the Moonsea. It is one of the most evil cities in the realms, a blight on the North, and a haven for Evil groups, plotting manipulators, dark religions, and foul practices. Its rulers seek to dominate the lands around it, including the Dragonspine Mountains, Yulash, Voonlar, and the neighboring Dales. The city of Zhentil Keep and its armies (known as the Zhentilar, to make matters more confusing) have destroyed Teshendale, come close to destroying Daggerdale, and for a long time had an agent ruling Shadowdale. 

The Zhentarim is an organization of evil priests, wizards, and inhuman creatures bent on controlling all the trade and power between the Sword Coast (meaning Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep) and the Moonsea (including the intervening lands of Cormyr and Anauroch). Its aims in the Moonsea area are the same as Zhentil Keep's, and the two factions work hand-in-glove, often sharing the same membership. The Zhentarim have a more far-reaching effect than Zhentil Keep, though, and have agents throughout the North.

In addition, the Zhentarim are not limited to Zhentil Keep itself, and maintain a number of fortified outposts. Their rulership has spread with the passing years. In addition to being the dominant force in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim control the Citadel of the Raven and Darkhold, two important castle complexes. Over the years, more power has been moving away from Zhentil Keep (filled with a lot of unknown and untrustworthy flunkies) and into these more secure areas. 

Within the Dalelands area, Zhentarim smells of Zhentil Keep and vice versa, but in reality not every Keeper (yet another name for a native of Zhentil Keep) is of the Black Network, and not every agent of the Zhentarim is from Zhentil Keep. Adventurers should watch who they trust as a result.

@7326  = ~History of Ulgarth:  

Ulgarth was settled by the great empire of Raurin, in the height of its power. When the empire was destroyed, it endured centuries of barbarism. Warchiefs united the country several times during this period. They fought many skirmishes with other barbarians, particularly those in Durpar and Var the Golden. In 202 DR, the barbarian tribes were nearly wiped out by the forces of Mulhorand.

In 348 DR, a group of outlaws, fleeing the justice of the priest-kings of Mulhorand, came to Ulgarth. There they found a fertile, almost unoccupied land. They settled down, and began raising children and crops. This new society in Ulgarth gradually grew in power, while its neighbors grew apace. But while Durpar grew as a result of its commerce and its philosophy of balance, Ulgarth concentrated on agrarian pursuits. The Ulgarthians developed a highly structured caste system of lords and peasants. In 1002 DR, the centuries long skirmishes between Durpar and Ulgarth came to an end, as the two countries finally reached a balance of power. There were too many centuries of warfare between the countries for them to completely trust each other. With their mutual border well defended on both sides, both countries have given up on the idea of conquering the other.

Trade between the Ulgarth and the Shining Lands has become a vital factor to both nations. Ulgarth produces many of the items that Durparians trade throughout the world. In return, Durpar trades many exotic items to Ulgarth. Of course, the Durparian merchants usually get the better of any trade. The current king, Drasna the Fortunate, has continued on his predecessor's policy of non-aggression with the Durparians.

@7327  = ~History of the Drow, The Descent: 

We know very little of the Ilythiiri, or "elves of the South," before this crucial event. Even then they were known as "dark elves," for the hue of their skins. They dwelt in the jungles and hot forests of the South. A proud, warlike, culturally advanced (some sages of other elven peoples say "decadent") folk, the Ilythiiri attacked all neighbors, including other elven tribes. Their cruel raids and depredations, ordered by warlike nobility and the clergy of their two cruel deities, Ghaunadaur and Lolth, forced elves, humans, dwarves, and others to ally against them. 

Defeated in a series of titanic magical battles, the dark elves fled into underground warrens they had earlier discovered. This event, known as "the Descent," marked the end of the drow as a surface-dwelling race.~
@7328  = ~History of the Drow, The Dark Wars: 

The warlike drow nature did not change when they escaped their surface foes during the Descent. In fact, they immediately launched a series of wars to establish territories in the Underdark. They began by stealing and seizing dwarven magical items and using them against the dwarves—establishing an enmity that is still strong today.

The drow then fought among themselves, noble against noble, priest against priestess, for rule of their new realm. This all-out war ended amid great magical explosions that brought down the roof of the largest dwarven cavern they had seized, great Bhaerynden. The ceiling collapsed entirely, burying many drow and the shattered dwarven cities. The cavern, now open to the sky, became known as the Great Rift. The surviving drow nobles gathered what people, slaves, and equipment they could seize and fled into the Underdark in search of places to dwell. "The Scattering" brought about the many rival, self-interested cities where most drow live today.~
@7329  = ~History of Waterdeep— Age 0, Trademoots and Pioneers: 

Few now know the true history of this great city, which had its beginnings over a thousand years ago, when the North was truly what Southerners still sneeringly call it: "the Savage North." In those days, most of the North was covered with vast, tall forests of ancient green, and inhabited by dwarves and goblinkind (in the most northern mountains and foothills) and elves (in widely scattered forest enclaves everywhere else). A few primitive human tribes lived along the Sword Coast, fishing and hunting and gathering in spring and fall to trade their furs for the merchants' jewelry and metal tools, or the occasionally-available weapon or two, with vessels sailing in from the South. In the spring, these vessels came primarily to cut and take huge trees for shipbuilding, trees being no longer available in such large sizes farther south.

In the fall, the vessels came in to cut timber for their own repairs, or to take on a cargo of wood if the misfortunes of trading had left their holds low or empty. Most of these trademoots were at a certain place where there was a great natural deepwater harbor, protected from the sea by a rocky spur of land, an arm of an isolated coastal crag, and a rocky island beyond it.~
@7330  = ~History of Waterdeep— Age I, The Rise of the Warlords:

Over the years, the forest was cut back farther and farther from the shore, and tribes began to stay most of the year there, farming the cleared land. The wiser among them claimed and controlled some of the timber in order to trade for more weaponry and tools. Such claims angered many who found the squatters rich from frequent trade, and brought attacks from land and sea, the more warlike tribes slaughtering the more sedentary settlers. Noted among these tribes was that led by Nimoar, a chieftain who ordered his people to seize the farms, crude wooden docks, trading sheds, and storage barns built up around the bay. They settled there themselves, and erected a log palisade within an earthen embankment to protect the holdings, After several abortive pirate and tribal raids, Nimoar's people thrived in their new home, a fledgling town referred to as "the town of Water-deep."

Farther north, orc tribes had outgrown their mountain strongholds. Attempts to expand underground met with fierce dwarven resistance (although many small gnomish colonies were overwhelmed and wiped out), and the orcs spread out on the surface of the land, coming south and down out of the mountains, hurling their seemingly endless numbers against all who stood in their path. Here and there elven enclaves held out, but the push southward displaced many other northern inhabitants, including the "everlasting ones" (trolls), who came down into the newly-cleared lands northeast of Nimoar's Hold, those lands now known as the Trollmoors. Nimoar died of old age during this time of increasing danger. Younger War Lords led the men of Waterdeep (for so the ship-captains called the harbor) in battles against the trolls. There were many bloody struggles between men and trolls for a decade, until the magic of a Northern youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the trolls, and the "everlasting ones" were destroyed or scattered. Ahghairon rose 'slowly in skill and power with the passage of years, until he became a great mage. He discovered a supply of potions of longevity (or learned the art of making such), for he lived on, still physically a man in his prime, for decade upon decade.

Fearing further attacks, the men of Waterdeep raised a small keep on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep above their farms, where fire arrows from on high could defend against attacking trolls. Many outlying tribes who had come to the settlement for safety from the trolls stayed, and expanded the walls with new farms several times. War Lords ruled the Free City of Waterdeep, holding it independent and increasingly wealthy as years passed.~
@7331  = ~History of Waterdeep— Age III, The Bloody Reign of the Guildmasters:

There was great turmoil in the City as the Guildmasters argued amongst themselves as to who should govern the City, and more than one merchant of power was found murdered. Groups of liveried bodyguards appeared openly armed on the streets, accompanying their masters, and two very troubled months passed as they bickered and parleyed (and occasionally dueled in the streets). At last, they decided that all Masters should rule Waterdeep together, in a council, The lesser nobles and many townsfolk protested, saying that the Lords ruled by right and by the peoples' consent, but the Guildmasters said that the Lords had not been seen since Ahghairon's death, and that they must always have been golems or zombies controlled by Ahghairon himself, to conceal his lone rule, and indeed, the Lords were silent and unseen, and continued to be so.

In truth, the Lords were real men and women whose identities had been compromised, over the years, by certain curious Guildmasters who had ordered them slain by their own closemouthed, loyal servants following Ahghairon's death. The only Lords still surviving (those who had remained secret) were Baeron, a woodworker, and Shilam, an apprentice wizard. These surviving Lords kept very quiet, and waited. The Guildmasters thought all the living Lords of the City had been eliminated, and took firm rule over Waterdeep.

The Guildmasters ruled Waterdeep for only six years ere their self-interested squabbling led to bloodshed. Open quarrels and a few murders quickly erupted into a brief but vicious series of street fights and midnight attacks. This strife, ofttimes termed "the Guildwars" by sages (although it was never as long-drawn-out or so formal as to be called a "war" when it was taking place), left all but two Guildmasters dead, most of the City's best minds stilled, and much of the City's gold wasted or plundered with the Guilds in disarray.

The surviving Guildmasters were Lhorar Gildeggh of the Shipwrights and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters. These two—ruthless manipulators both—were well-matched and could not overcome each other, though their private armies clashed often in the streets. At length, they sickened of bloodshed, after many from both families were dead in the gutters, and agreed to rule together. Two thrones were set up in Castle Waterdeep, and from then the two argued bitterly over this and that, and the City was a place of tension and fear. All matters, including the recognition of new Guildmasters to rule the "headless" guilds, had to come before the Two Lords Magister, as Lhorar and Ehlemm were called. Few matters were settled.~
@7332  = ~History of Waterdeep—Age II, The Lords' Rule Begins: 

In his 112th winter, Ahghairon had a sharp disagreement with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeep's acquired wealth and strength-of-arms to create a Northern empire, with Waterdeep its capital (and Raurlor its ruler), and gathered armies for the purpose. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered the mage be chained. Ahghairon magically struck aside all who sought to lay hands on him. In a fury Raurlor struck at the mage with his own blade. Ahghairon rose into the air, just out of reach, and, as the infuriated Warlord slashed repeatedly at his rising feet, gestured. Raurlor's blade transmuted in his hand, from steel into a hissing serpent, which promptly bit him. The Warlord died of the venom before the shocked people assembled there. Ahghairon then gathered all the captains of Waterdeep's army, and all the seniors of the 'families of Waterdeep. While runners sought to bring them to the Castle, flames roared and crackled in the Warlord's empty chair-of-state at Ahghairon's bidding, so that no one sat there. Then at a gesture from the mage, the flames were gone as though they had never been, leaving the chair unmarked. Ahghairon seated himself, then, and proclaimed himself the first Lord of Waterdeep, saying that henceforth wisdom and not armed might would rule in the city. He would gather some few—in secret—to rule as Lords with him, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people, but equal to him in authority and free of coercion by any, himself included. These Lords were to be drawn from all walks of life in the city, and could serve as long as they wished. 

The people heard, and agreed, and for the next two hundred years, Ahghairon ruled Waterdeep with his unknown fellow Lords, Over the years, the masked Lords were a group of sometimes five, six, or seven, who appeared seldom and said little. Some whispered that they were Ahghairon's servants, or even magical automatons controlled by the Old Mage. Still, Ahghairon's justice was swift and fair, his laws good, his guardsmen polite and just as ready to help as apprehend, and the people approved. The years passed in peace and prosperity. The North was opened to humans. Roads built under Ahghairon's direction linked it together, from the ruins of "the Fallen Kingdom," which had been shattered by goblin races' attacks before men were numerous in the North, to the cities that would later become Amn. Waterdeep grew fivefold in size and wealth. From all over the realms, folk began to come to the "Crown of the North," drawn by money—and among them came those who rob, cheat, and steal. When word of doings extending beyond simple theft to deception-in-workmanship and the appearance of many fly-by-night impostor craftsmen reached Ahghairon's ears, he called together the senior merchants, "the Noble Ones," and suggested that they form guilds as was done in the far South to police the unscrupulous of their own professions. Some resisted, or were furious, but most saw the advantages of such an arrangement, particularly if they were free to set matters up themselves, and not have less favorable arrangements forced upon them. The Guilds were created forthwith, Waterdeep continued to grow in size and prosperity, Twice more the city walls were expanded, and its merchants traveled the world over, bringing back exotic goods from afar, and spreading word of the city's wealth to remote lands. In the South, some listened with an eye to conquest or at least plunder, but swords were already out in those southern lands in a time of widespread strife, and no invaders came. 

Ahghairon's health eventually failed and he died. He was buried with ceremony in his tower, which was secured against thieves and fools. Those who learned the arts arcane from the Old Mage cast the most potent protective magics known upon his home and resting-place (which, many believe, remains inviolate today).
~
@7333  = ~History of Waterdeep—Age IV, The Return of the Lords:

One day to the Courts of the Lord Magister came two people masked and robed as the Lords of Waterdeep of old. Where they came from no one knew, but they appeared in the Castle's Great Hall where the Courts were, and commanded the Lords Magister to leave the city forthwith. Laughing, the Lords Magister refused, whereupon the shorter of the masked intruders (the lady Shilam, apprentice to Ahghairon and his undeclared heir as first Lord of the City) blasted them with lightning and fire, and their very thrones were shattered and toppled.

The taller of the two intruders (Baeron) then called for the heads of the noble houses to come to them, or leave the city forthwith and forever, if they cared not to come by nightfall. All in the Courts heard, and the news was cried in the streets.

The surviving nobles came, reluctantly and with bodyguards, expecting such a summons to be a trap. Baeron spoke to them and the crowd of curious townsfolk that had also come, saying, "this must not happen again." If Waterdeep was to be safe once more, he told them, all must support what he and his fellow Lord now planned, as they had supported Ahghairon in the past. The two would choose others to be Lords as before, he said, and they would rule in secret, as before—save for himself. He removed his mask, and said, "I am Baeron. I would be Lord as Ahghairon was before. I would be safe in this my city again." And the folk of Waterdeep there agreed. Shilarn, still masked, commanded that the houses of the Two Lords Magister be Outcast. There was protest, and she raised her hands that had blasted the thrones, and it was still again. And the house of Gildeggh and of Zoar were outcast.

Peace returned to the city, and Waterdhavians to their labors. To inhibit discovery of who the Lords were, Baeron selected certain men of character whom he knew well, and appointed them Magisters ("Black Robes," they were soon called, from their robes of office) under the Lords, to judge and apply the laws of Waterdeep in daily affairs. These Magisters he paid well, to raise them from temptation, and gave lodgings to those who feared for safety to dwell among the people. To so serve, he told the city, was a burden, not a proud misuse of authority, and if any wished to no longer serve, or were found wanting, they were not to be vilified, but accorded respect. And over the Magisters the Lords sat in their Court, to correct and overrule the judgments of the Magisters. Baeron told the people that none were to decry or belittle any judgments of Magisters that the Lord saw fit to alter or cast aside. If any thought ill of the offices or those who held them they could turn back to the rule of sword and whim, and perish as had those before them. Before the Lord's Court Baeron encouraged people to speak freely for the length of a short candle's burning, without fear of chastisement or reproach from the Lords for anything said, as long as they spoke openly and answered questions or opposing views put to them by any there. Thus, he held, just grievances of folk would be heard, no matter how small the matter or lowly the speaker. And so it was. Slow to take hold, until people knew it for careful justice, but enduring beyond Baeron's time, and beyond Shilarn's time, and beyond the time of their daughter Lhestyn "The Masked Lady," who wed Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, and was mother to Khelben "Blackstaff' Arunsun, a Lord of Waterdeep today, who knows the secrets of long years as Ahghairon did. And as the years have passed, Waterdeep has grown in size and variety, flourishing with good trade under the tolerance and protection of strong defenders and good government. The years passed not without troubles, varying from the Godswar (when Waterdeep played host to gods dying and ascending) to such occurrences as a green dragon assailing the Field of Triumph (part of a plot by the Knights of the Shield to overthrow the Lords' Rule), but the city and her peoples survived and prevailed against all strife. The Lords' Alliance provides continued safety for all the settlements of the northern Sword Coast and those inland, with Waterdeep as the heart of the alliance. Though it can be matched in size or commerce, there is no city the realms over that compares to the sheer variety of life and experiences found in fair Waterdeep, Crown of the North.~
@7334  = ~History of the Unicorn Run: 

Bards and sages pass down the tale that the headwaters of the Unicorn Run are, in truth, the Font of Life and a cradle of fecundity. Each natural race is said to have emerged from the womb of Chauntea onto Toril at the river's source and then traveled down the Unicorn Run to the outside world. Some say that a daughter of Chauntea resides at the river's source to usher the newborns into the world, while others claim that Shialla midwifes the process.

Regardless of the truth, the elves, korreds, and halflings all agree that the Unicorn Run is sacred to life and a site of incredible purity. As a result, all three races have strong taboos about extended trips up the run, for if the river is ever fouled, then no new races will ever be born on Toril again.~
@7335  = ~History of the Dead Three: "KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE"

In ages past, there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything. Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and powers alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built his power into a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. Eventually, however, he grew tired of his duties for he knew them too well. Without challenge there is nothing, and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable. 

During this dark era, there arose three powerful mortals—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who lusted after the power Jergal wielded. The trio forged an unholy pact, agreeing that they would dare to seek such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the realms they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually the trio destroyed one of the Seven Lost Gods, and they each seized a portion of his divine essence for themselves. 

The trio then journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes or noncorporeal undead, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest—the Bone Throne. 

"I claim this throne of evil," shouted Bane the tyrant.

"I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened Bhaal the assassin.

"And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised Myrkul the necromancer. 

Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, " The Throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish—I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position." Before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead continued, "who among you shall rule?"

The trio immediately fell to fighting amongst themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened. "after all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office and engage in a game of skill for them?" asked Jergal. 

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed. Jergal took the heads of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio that they would compete by bowling the skulls. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest. 

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would get all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting as it was obvious their sport was ruined, and again Jergal intervened. "Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide so you don't have to share with the Beast?"

The trio agreed, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the players. When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.

Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom."

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die—even gods."

Bhaal, who finished third, demurred, "I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule Lord Bane will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul by staying my hand."

Malar growled in frustration but could do nothing, and yet again only the beasts were left for him. 

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.

@7336  = ~History of the Last March of the Giants:

East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans. This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerûn, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance. In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch of the land with fascination and his brethren with devotion. The powers then dropped a star onto the land. The impact of the fallen star created a huge valley later known as the Sea of Fallen Stars. Slowly picking up speed, the gall rolled through the titan nation and onward to the south.

Unable to contain his curiosity, the titan king ran off after the bouncing sphere and his devoted followers dutifully followed his tracks. The meteorite rolled on and on until it reached the Great Sea and vanished into the depths. The monarch dove into the sea, and, lemming-like, the entire titan race dove in after him, never to be seen again.

Ashamed at the destruction they had wrought, the powers vowed to keep both curiosity and loyalty firmly in check to avoid such disasters in the future. They have done so to this day, preventing both new ideas form being pursued with any speed and the intelligent races of Toril from ever fully cooperating.~
@7337  = ~History of the Sisters of Light and Darkness:

This was the birth of the world and the heavens. After Lord Ao created Realmspace, there was a period of timeless nothingness, a misty realm of shadows before light and dark were separate entities. Within this dim chaos stalked 13 lords of shadow, the Shadevari—whether they came form elsewhere or are children of the shadow itself, none can say.

Eventually this primordial essence coalesced into twin beautiful goddesses who were yin and yang to each other; they were so close they thought of themselves as one being. The Two-Faced Goddess created the heavenly bodies of the crystal sphere and together infused them with life to form the Earthmother, Chauntea. (Although Chauntea has since contracted her essence to encompass only Abeir-Toril, in the beginning she embodied all matter in Realmspace.)  This new universe was lit by the face of the silver-haired goddess, who called herself Selûne, and darkened by the welcoming tresses of the raven-haired goddess, Shar, but no heat or fire existed within it.

Chauntea begged for warmth so that she could nurture life and living creatures upon the planets that were her body and limbs, and the two sisters-Who-Were-One become divided, as for the first time they were of two minds. Silvery Selûne contested with her dark sister over whether or not to bring further life to the worlds. During this great conflagration, the gods of war, disease, murder, and death, among others, were created from residues of the deific battle. At one point during the battle, Selûne seized the advantage and reached across time and space to a land of eternal fire. Fighting the pain of the blaze, which burned her sorely, she broke off a fragment of that ever-living flame and ignited one of the heavenly bodies so that it burned in the sky and warmed Chauntea.

Incensed, Shar redoubled her attack on her injured twin and began to snuff out all light and heat throughout the crystal sphere. Again Selûne gave of herself and tore the divine essence of magic from her body, flinging it desperately at her sister in defense of life in the sphere. This essence entered Shar, ripped an equal portion of energy from her, and reformed behind her as the goddess of magic, known now as Mystra, but then as Mystryl. Though Mystryl was composed of both light and dark magic, she favored her first mother Selûne initially, allowing the silver goddess to win an uneasy truce with her more powerful, dark twin. Consumed by bitterness at her defeat, Shar vowed eternal revenge.

The twin goddesses contested for eons as life struggled into existence on Toril and the other planets under Chauntea's watchful gaze. Shar remained powerful, but bitterly alone, while Selûne waxed and waned in power, often drawing strength from her allied Daughters and sons and like-minded immigrant deities. Over time, Shar grew strong again, aided by the shadevari who preferred night to blinding light and who stalked the realms seeking to meld light and dark into shadowy chaos once again. Shar's plot to reform the world after her own desires was undone when Azuth, the High One, formerly the greatest of all mortal spellcasters and now consort to Mystra (incarnate successor to Mystryl), found a way to imprison the shadevari in a pocket-sized crystal sphere located beyond the edges of the world by creating the illusion of a realm of shadows. The Lords of Shadow were drawn to investigate, and before they discovered the trick, Azuth imprisoned the shadevari with the Shadowstar, a key of shadows forged by Gond. The High Lord then hurled the key into the endless reaches of the cosmos allowing life to flourish on in Chauntea's loving hands.~
@7338  = ~History of the Valley of the Gods: 

It is said that even the powers must cavort and amuse themselves once in a great while. Far to the north of the Spine of the World is the Valley of the Gods. A paradise unequaled on this world or in the planes, this playground of the gods is not meant for mortals. Any mortal who reaches the Valley becomes a deity, for only deities may exist in the Valley. Far too many mortals with delusions of grandeur have thrown away the pleasures of this side of the Spine and their kingdoms in this world, only to break their backs searching for the legendary Valley of the Gods.~
@7339  = ~History of the Fateful Coin:

Old tales tell that luck plays a crucial role in each person's life. When each newborn baby enters into the realms, Tymora flips a coin formed from the remnants of the original goddess of luck, Tyche. Beshaba calls it in the air—the moon (heads) or the cloak (tails). If Beshaba is right, that person is cursed with misfortune for the rest of his or her days. If she's wrong, Lady Luck smiles on that child for the rest of his or her life. For some rare beings, the coin lands edge on—and these luckless few can forge their own fates, for they have more freedom over their destinies than the powers themselves.~
@7340  = ~Battle axe +2: 'Battleaxe of Mauletar'
During the Tethyr civil war, the Battleaxe of Mauletar was in the possession of the house of Ossyind. This noble family was betrayed while trying to flee the country, and Mauletar, lead guard and personal friend, took up the axe and sacrificed himself to buy enough time for his companions to flee. His battle cry was favored by the gods, and was echoed across the lands as a symbol of devoted friendship and loyalty. Thus, the magical axe was used to uphold these virtues, to be used against those who lacked honor and courage.

A person could chip through stone with this dagger and the edge would still remain razor sharp.

@7343  = ~Rhyte's Last Arrow +2
The tale of this weapon lost its significance in the sea of great stories that are told about the High Forest, but some bards still sing the song of the skilled archer Adaniss Rhyte.
 
"Oh, shocked from the strike of his powerful bow,
The slain game sought by Adaniss falls.
Long ago in the time of the Quiet Earth,
The hunt from the famed High Forest calls.

"The Duke of Everlund known for his boast 
Of the trophies held in his pride as dear. 
Intensely enraged at his rival hunter
Whose bounty by far surpassed his one year. 

"One morn tragedy befell the land
With the misconceived death of the Duke's prized hound.
Fallen at the base of a great elm tree 
A bow's shot death in its heart was found. 

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The same eve Adaniss called on the Duke,
His solemn mistake he wished to repay.
But the noble's rage claimed ten pounds of flesh
And an archer's arm hit the ground that day.

"The evil lord demanded justice unjust
The most vile curse on his arm to be cast.
Vengeance he sought for the price he had paid
Rhyte vowed the hound's arrow not to be his last.

"In sorrow the town helped him forge an axe
Blessed to honor his most glorious day.
With the mark of Rhyte's arrow to guide its strike
And reputed to kill in the very same way.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"Again called the forest with its precious game,
And a prize Adaniss with thrill did he seek. 
But none could be finer than the great clawed falcon 
Sought by all amidst the forest's Lost Peaks.

"Once more the rivalry of the Duke did stir,
For he thought of his skills with Rhyte's bow to be best.
And set his sights on the glorious bird 
To emerge as the holder of its sainted crest.

"The two climbed the peaks and searched days on end,
Each of their wills set as strong as the stone.
They found each other at a cliff by chance;
Both of their hatreds ran as deep as the bone.

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

"The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string taut,
But first flew Adaniss's axe with its blow.
Cleaved, the lord stumbled to cliff's edge and off,
Defeated by Rhyte's last arrow...

"With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte."

Suryris, a white minotaur who traveled the Orsraun mountains in Turmish, lived for nothing but the thrill of combat and encouraged warriors to challenge him for his magical weapon: a powerful halberd. Despite his aggressive nature, he was an honorable combatant and never slew opponents he could overpower. Suryris met his superior only once, in a battle that lasted hours and had the minotaur often fearing defeat. The contest ended when his opponent's sword broke, but Suryris knew he likely would have been bested had it continued. He presented his weapon to the astonished man, who thereafter told of this noble creature to anyone who would listen.

Blades of this type were long used by Sharran priests during the sacrificial rites of "Feast of the Moon" ceremonies. Legends say that, when she passed on, the remains of this sword's wielder were mummified, and the blade was placed within her chest as a symbol of power. In the first stage of a long-forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form. Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few that knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity. Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts. Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated that she became one with the very blade of her weapon. Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own. It is now exceedingly deadly in combat.

Amidst the plains of the Eastern Shaar there lived a small human blacksmith, whose nearly dwarven height did not do his soul justice. Though a skilled weaponsmith, his true gift was his ability to whistle a heartfelt song that could cause a grown man to cry like a newborn. Only a reclusive mage shared and enjoyed time with the diminutive man, however, as others could only see his small size as a source of amusement. Deaf to the smith's song because of their own prejudices, their ridicule slowly grew into cruel torment which eventually persuaded the lighthearted man to leave his home forever. Before he left, he forged this weapon as a gift for his one friend, who also enchanted it during the making. Thus the blade sweetly whistles to its wielder when unsheathed. It was not long after that the mage also deserted the small town in disgust, taking the sword with him on his journeys.

Rumors say the shock was so intense that the poor fellow's beard caught fire. In exchange for his life, the gnomish inventor relinquished the secret to his special alloy to the dwarven weaponsmith, who now makes a comfortable living fashioning various weapons using the alloy.

With the help of powerful forest animals, Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood. The orcs were forced to abandon their plans lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest. Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily... nay, VERY happily ever after!

As predicted, enemy troops attempted to seize the king and force their will over his rule, but none had anticipated the amazing accuracy and lethality of the hidden archers. The king was able to escape unharmed; in fact, none of the ambush members even lived to approach him.

The wearer can change form whenever <PRO_HESHE> wishes. Relair was not so lucky.

The most infamous owner of this item forever tainted its reputation, though it is still a truly useful item. Morinden of the Wicked Heart made his living looting the bodies of those he slew. He would goad true warriors into duels of honor -though he had little knowledge of the subject—and laugh as their blades glanced off him. Eventually he met his end at the hands of a frustrated woodsman, who had wisely cast his sword aside in favor of a tree stump.

Thirty years later, mind flayers destroyed the hook horrors and took the dagger back to their community. The merchant Nym traded deep gnome slaves to the mind flayers in exchange for the dagger, which was eventually sold to Malavon.

Zilzanzer eventually decided that he should make an item to protect him from petrification. The result was the Ring of the Gorgon. Sages believe that Beshaba must have smiled upon Zilzanzer when he was born, for he was turned to stone when he put on the ring. His assistant dutifully read the Stone to Flesh scroll, bringing Zilzanzer out of his stone form. Unfortunately, Zilzanzer died in the process, this time forever.

Kay made dozens of enemies everywhere he went because of his acidic wit and appetite for confrontation. Sages believe that Milil frowned upon Pellon's antics, but that Talos found Pellon's attitude to be quite amusing. The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night. As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the lute that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body. After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his lute in their direction. He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks. Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical lute. The unknown warrior threw the lute into the Sea of Fallen Stars.

@7653  = ~This sword was made with one purpose: to destroy evil. Though a powerful weapon, Pale Justice has humble beginnings. The plain sword was crafted by a devout worshipper of Tyr named Renold. Renold spent thirty years of his life perfecting the metalworking techniques that allowed him to craft an almost flawless blade. As soon as Renold had completed the unadorned weapon, he turned it over to the church of Tyr. The priest who received it placed the naked blade on his monastery's altar. He asked his brothers to join him in praying to Tyr to ask their god to bless the weapon with holy power. The brothers never touched the blade, nor did they speak of it. After ten years, despite the fact that all of the other brothers lost faith in the blade ever becoming enchanted, the original priest, Edan, continued his prayers in silence. Another twenty years passed, and there was still no sign from Tyr. Visiting priests of Helm scoffed at Edan's blind devotion to the blade. It was then that, without warning, Edan walked up to the altar and gently removed the dust-covered blade from the altar.

The priest of Helm asked Edan if he had finally come to his senses. Edan replied that he had, that he had been expecting the wrong thing from Tyr the entire time. He stated that Tyr had done his work long ago.

The priest of Helm laughed out loud at Edan's claim and asked his bodyguard to draw his sword. The magnificent weapon in the hand of the Helmite had a gilded guard set with pearls. Runes were etched along the blade, with a small cluster of fine rubies set in the ricasso. The priest of Helm laughed again and spoke. "This is truly a sword blessed by the gods. Your weapon looks like an ordinary soldier's blade. It pales in comparison."

Edan calmly grabbed the blade by the tang and swatted at the guard's weapon. The priest of Helm's laughter cut off quickly as he stared down at his retainer's broken weapon. He stood there speechless as Edan set the blade down and began to reply.

"Justice always pales in comparison to vanity and ostentatious displays of power. I expected Tyr to manifest his divine will in this blade with lightning and fire. I should have remembered how the blade was given to me... with simple charity and humility. Justice is the right of every man, no matter how rich or poor, no matter how educated or ignorant. It should be found as often in the fields of farmers as it is in the fields of battle."

Edan took the blade to a local weaponsmith and had him put a wooden, leather-wrapped grip on it. He then gave it to a fledgling paladin and asked him to always remember the potential for charity and kindness in the human race.

I fear much of the knowledge I possess is beyond your comprehension. Perhaps, in the future you may be worthy of such advanced knowledge.~
@7696  = ~Hmm. No matter... at least you have located the ruins for me. I'm sure the answers I seek are merely lying about some hidden chamber in the tower, waiting to be discovered. If you return to the ruins and happen upon any such materials, please deliver them to me here. I am willing to pay a handsome reward for such a service.~

At the culmination of this dreadful spell, the wizard screams like a banshee (groaning spirit). For each level of the caster, one listener within 30 ft. hears the wail. Those who fail a Save vs. Death die instantly.

The caster is not affected by the spell, but cannot choose who will be affected. Creatures who cannot hear due to ear plugs or deafness may be targets but cannot be affected and automatically make their Saving Throws.~

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard weakens an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim is reduced to a Strength of 5 for the duration of the spell, unless a save vs. Spell is made. This spell does not affect combat bonuses due to magical items, and those conferring increased Strength function normally. However the target receives all of the penalties for a 5 Strength, such as attack and damage penalties, as well as lower weight allowance.~

This spell creates a translucent, shadowlike, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. This silent construct is blade-shaped. Its cutting edges inflict damage just as do those of a real sword. The caster wields the phantom blade as if proficient with this weapon, at her normal THAC0.

The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword in terms of hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit. However due to its etheric nature it causes double damage against undead or any other planar creatures. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in her hand for the duration or until dispelled.~

Wizards need not always be wizards—Tenser's Transformation changes the caster into a heroic warrior, doubling the caster's Hit Points and giving <PRO_HIMHER> a +4 bonus to Armor Class, a +2 bonus to damage, and one extra attack per round.

This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift, about three feet long. It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The caster is considered to be proficient in this weapon. The sword acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2d12 damage to its victims. While using this weapon, the wizard uses the THAC0 of a Fighter of half <PRO_HISHER> level. For example, if this is cast by an 18th-level wizard, <PRO_HESHE> would use combat tables for a 9th-level Fighter and hence <PRO_HISHER> base THAC0 would be 12. Also, every time this hits a target the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated.~

@7869  = ~At first, nothing. For days we waited, always expecting the temperature to rise, but it never did. We had finally given up hope when, just yesterday, a commotion started and the salamanders fled this room in a flurry of confusion. Vera saw this as our one chance at freedom. We could not allow the salamanders time to reorganize and cut off our access to this room. So, she yelled for all of us to run to the stairs that led here. Many died in the attempt.

Static Charge is similar to Call Lightning, except it can be used indoors. This spell allows the caster to generate a static charge around any creature within the area of effect, dealing 2d8 points of electrical damage plus an additional 1d8 points per level of the caster (save vs. Spell for half).

By reciting a sacred passage or declaration, the priest invokes <PRO_HISHER> deity's blessing upon <PRO_HIMHER>self and <PRO_HISHER> allies while sowing confusion and weakness among <PRO_HISHER> enemies. The priest's allies gain a +2 bonus to their attack rolls and Saving Throws, and the priest's enemies receive a -2 penalty to the same. Recitation does not nullify a Prayer spell—the two can be cast in tandem, and the effects are cumulative.~

This spell snuffs out the lives of creatures in the area of effect. The weaker the creatures, the more are affected. For example, this spell could kill 4d20 goblins within the area of effect, 2d20 lizard men, 2d4 ogres, or 1d4 trolls. This spell does not affect undead creatures. Characters slain by a Death Spell cannot be resurrected—they are gone forever.~

None know better than halflings the value of a well-placed stone when confronting a larger foe. This particular weapon was the property of a young woman named Arla Surestep, one of the few small-folk that leave the hearth to seek adventure. Legend speaks of the diminutive Arla using this sling to place a well-sharpened pebble through the skull of a green dragon in mid-flight, though the same tale in another tavern places the stone squarely in the creature's hindquarters for more humorous than lethal effect. It would seem that halflings prefer entertainment over accuracy when it comes to their history.

Symbol, Hopelessness is a powerful enchantment that allows the priest to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface.

Along the way, despite his many victories, Kheros became disgusted and terrified by the sight of blood.

His fear eventually spiraled out of control, consuming him with madness. Priests of Tempus found the huge warrior and took him into safekeeping. The priests believed that they could cure Kheros of his fear. Over several years, Kheros learned the ways of the Tempuran religion, eventually becoming a priest. His final step in overcoming his fear was being submerged in a tub of blood until he almost drowned. All the time he was held down, he never struggled, flinched, or tried to escape. In his later years, he had a suit of armor made to remind him of his past.

The priest's evil magic brought him back from the dead. This priest, called "the Chamberlain Haunt," cursed the Chamberlain family to only produce stillborn children until he had been appeased. Matthain, as the heir to the family, took it upon himself to remove the curse. The Chamberlain Haunt told Matthain that he must kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Matthain began his grim task, slaughtering every knight he came across. He brought the skull and shield of each warrior to the Chamberlain Haunt as proof of his deed. The king dispatched bands of knights and heroes to kill Matthain, but he proved too difficult a foe. Finally, after three years of murdering, Matthain had killed one hundred knights. He told the Chamberlain Haunt that it was time to end the curse. The Chamberlain Haunt corrected him, reminding the fallen paladin that he had to kill one hundred and one knights of the king.

Overcome with misery and regret, Matthain nodded and immediately threw himself on his own spear. With Matthain and Garlan dead, and the letter of his requirements fulfilled, the curse was ended and the Chamberlain Haunt was called to Acheron by Bane, screaming all the way.

Valiant's owners survived through many incredible ordeals, mostly because of the magic of the weapon. The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport. The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions. Ilban's exploits took Valiant into battle against sandmen, giant scorpions, desert raiders, evil sorcerers, and the demonic servants of Celan Harad.

The cloak was actually the cause of his doom, for it was woven and enchanted by his dark elf lover, Rauva Vrinn. The style of the black and midnight-blue cloak was so obviously non-elven that his associates became suspicious. 

Eventually, an acquaintance of Mithran, an elven drow-hunter named Gaedel, discovered Rauva's secluded hiding spot in the forests surrounding Myth Nantar. With a small band of warriors, Gaedel stormed her hut and quickly killed her. When Mithran discovered what had happened, he went berserk with fury. The mad mage assaulted the hunting lodge of Gaedel and his brothers, killing them all and leveling the lodge. Gaedel's family eventually attempted to take vengeance for the act, killing Mithran at the loss of most of their house. Mithran's cloak was recovered by his close friend, the dwarven warrior Hael Bronzelake. Had it not been, it would have been swallowed up under the waves with Myth Nantar when that proud city was drowned in the Sea of Fallen Stars several years later.

The money you have received from Tranzig should cover your usual fee. Your assignment is a difficult one, but I'm sure that you are up to the task. There is a group of mercenaries who should be coming through Nashkel in the next few days. They are led by a whelp named <GABBER>. You are to kill <GABBER>, and all that travel with them. I warn you; they might not look like much, but they are very dangerous. Good hunting!

TAZOK

@8914  = ~[Note from Davaeorn to Tazok 1]Tazok,
I hope that everything moves along smoothly. I have written to give you instructions from our superiors. I have been told that a small band of mercenaries might cause the Iron Throne some trouble in the future. You are to ensure that they don't live to upset our operations. Obtain the services of the assassin Nimbul, he should serve you well.

Davaeorn~
@8915  = ~[Note from Davaeorn to Tazok 2]Tazok,
I have noticed that your shipments of iron have slowed of late. It is imperative that we receive another ton of ore. Step up your raids, and get a shipment to our base in Cloakwood within the next week. We need to stockpile as much ore as possible before our ultimatum is given. Also, Sarevok wants to know what has happened with the band of mercenaries. Have they been killed? You had better ensure that they have been, as Sarevok will not take kindly to any other news.

Davaeorn~
@8916  = ~[Note from Tuth to Reiltar]Reiltar,
My superiors are intrigued by your proposal. I would like to discuss it further, but not through correspondence such as this. The Harpers and Zhents have been very active in this region as of late; it would be very unfortunate if they tried to disrupt an alliance between our two organizations. If you, Bruno, and Thaldorn were to meet with us in the safety of Candlekeep, my superiors would be much relieved. Please send a response ASAP.

TUTH~
@8917  = ~[Note from Sarevok to Reiltar]Father,
I received your letter, and I can assure you that the mercenaries led by <GABBER> will no longer trouble our operations. I have dealt with them personally. Before dying, they were most forthcoming in their revelations; it is as you had surmised; they were agents of the Zhentarim. I am also writing to tell you that I cannot attend the meeting at Candlekeep. Some problems have arisen with The Chill and the Black Talons. They have had trouble working with each other, and I am needed there to smooth over any dissension. I am sorry that I will not be at your side.

SAREVOK
~
@8918  = ~[The Personal Diary of Sarevok]Diary

14th of Eleint, 1367: Today Cormyr has instituted a ban against the Iron Throne from operating within their borders. While this is a great blow to the Iron Throne, it is the perfect opportunity for Reiltar to approach the Throne high council with his proposal. If things go well, we could begin the operation within the year.

25th of Marpenoth, 1367: Davaeorn has sent a message to Reiltar, informing him that the mines at Cloakwood have been drained and are ready for use. This revelation should help greatly in convincing the Throne high council.

2nd of Nightal, 1367: The Iron Throne council has agreed to support Reiltar's plan. He has been given all the resources he needs, as well as leadership of the project. I have expressed interest to my 'father', and he had promised to include me within the operations along the Sword Coast. He mentioned mother in our conversation: how I wasn't to be unfaithful to him as she had. He made it clear that I would suffer her fate if I was. His threats are weak and hollow, and I shall listen to them for only so long. I have decided to take this time to make my visit to Candlekeep. I have waited a long time to research the prophecies of Alaundo, and I must know if the dreams speak the truth. I will not believe the words of phantoms without proof, and the Priest of Bhaal I confronted gave me nothing. He was old and died quickly in my grasp. If the words are true, I shall surely groom stronger acolytes than this.

11th of Ches, 1368: My research has gone well. The monks here at Candlekeep have been quite helpful. From what I have read, it would seem certain that the blood of Bhaal does indeed flow through my veins. His prophecies are (of course) ambiguous, but I think I understand them. He foresaw his coming death, and seeded his essence across the land. The children born as a result bear the marks of chaos, have power with no direction, and shall feel the blood of a god within them. The deaths they bring shall awaken the father, and through them he will rise. It does not explicitly say, but obviously this means that death wrought by the children will cause them to ascend. Fitting, and since the father was the Lord of Murder, proving one's worth must involve an act in accordance with his portfolio. I begin to see what I must do. Death on a god-like scale.

3rd of Tarsahk, 1368: The monk Gorion troubles me. He seems to have taken an interest in my readings. I must be careful to be more clandestine in my research. I wish I could simply kill him, but I doubt I could safely murder him within this damnable library.

11th of Tarsahk, 1368: I had a dream this night. My mother was talking to me, but as she did her face became bloated and discolored. Her voice became weaker as she spoke to me, telling me to save her from Reiltar. I could see the garrote cutting into her neck, but I did nothing. It was only a dream. 

27th of Tarsahk, 1368: I take my leave of Candlekeep now, and not a moment too soon, for I am sure that Gorion has perceived my heritage. One thing that I am certain of: <GABBER> is, in actuality, one of Bhaal's brood as well. <GABBER> has all the markings, and it would explain Gorion's curiosity of my studies. Though there is nothing I can do now, I will have to make certain to return and kill the little brat. It would be foolish of me to let one of my siblings live, especially one being brought up by the Harpers (and I am sure that is where Gorion's allegiances lay).

5th of Mirtul, 1368: Today I met with Reiltar in Baldur's Gate. The fool still insists on calling me his son, and for now I will let him. He assumes that I am loyal to him because he raised me. Well, loyal I am, but only as long as he is useful. He's set up a base in the mansion of a destitute noble family and says that everything is running smoothly. Mulahey has established himself at the mines of Nashkel, and his kobold minions should be already busily contaminating the iron ore. Only a few slaves have begun to mine out the ore at Cloakwood, though Reiltar assures me that once the bandit raids begin we'll have a steady supply of new slaves.

8th of Hammer, 1369: I met with the leaders of the Chill, and Black Talons. I have little liking for Ardenor, the leader of the Chill, but Taugosz seems to be a man of his word. It is a good thing, as I'll have to work with these mercenaries for the rest of the year.

3rd of Tarsahk, 1370: Everything proceeds well. The ore coming from Nashkel has started to deteriorate, and my mercenaries have been doing a fine job at destroying any iron caravans on route to Baldur's Gate. Though some of my mercenaries have been captured, most think they work for the Zhents, so no trouble has fallen on the Iron Throne. I am sure that the Zhents at Darkhold won't be pleased to know that their name has been falsely used. I will have to be wary for Zhentish agents in the coming months.

28th of Tarsahk, 1370: I think I now have the time to deal with that old codger Gorion, and his little whelp. I will have to inform my men that I'll be gone for the next few weeks. 


? of Myrtle
No time to write, but I must not neglect my journals so. The future dead must know of how the Lord of Murder again came to them. I shall hire a scribe when time allows. Things have not gone completely as I have planned, but I will still be able to salvage the situation. <GABBER> is on the move to Baldur's Gate; if I could maneuver the whelp to Candlekeep, then I would have the perfect scapegoat for my plan. My mortal 'father,' Rieltar, is there to meet with the Knights of the Shield. He has been blocking all my attempts to escalate the hostilities between Amn and Baldur's Gate, and these meetings will only serve to smooth relations. I must rid myself of them all and assume control of the Iron Throne myself. I cannot allow petty business and monetary concerns to interfere. Terribly sorry, 'father,' but my true parentage calls and you are in my way. I shall be sure to instruct the dopplegangers in the exact manner Reiltar should die. I think a garrote would be perfect for the task.

@8919  = ~[Letter from Slythe to Sarevok 1]Sarevok,
I have received your letter and am quite overjoyed by your proposition. I have told my wife, and she is as excited as I am. I accept your mission and think that your payment is very adequate. This will be our greatest feat yet! To kill three Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate! We will be arriving in Baldur's Gate within a week, and should be taking up our usual residence at the Undercellar. If you wish to contact us, you will find us there. Use the access points through the sewers.

Joyfully yours,
Slythe.

@8920  = ~[Letter from Slythe to Sarevok 2]Sarevok,
I must say that our first victim was not the challenge that my wife and I had expected. The foppish idiot had only the most token of defense. However, I can assure you that Entar screamed quite deliciously all the way to the end. I hope that this next mission is much more difficult; from what you have told me it would seem to be. Assassinating two Grand Dukes in their own palace, while they harangue the high nobles of Baldur's Gate no less! I can't wait! You still know where to find us. You should come down and enjoy the pleasures of the Undercellar for yourself; but if I know you, that'll never happen.

Your obedient servant,
Slythe.
~
@8921  = ~[Letter from Sarevok to Slythe]Slythe,
The time to strike is now. When the party commences on the night of my coronation, you will join up with my doppelganger assassins at the sewer entrance to the palace. You are to insinuate yourself into the crowd in the ballroom. When I am finished with my speech, you will strike. If you aren't there, my doppelgangers will proceed without you, and your payment will be forfeit. Make sure to keep a leash on your little bitch of a wife. An invitation to the party is included with this note.

Sarevok.

(This looks to be an important note, one that you should hold on to.)~
@8922  = ~[Message from Sarevok to Prat]Prat,
My schemes have come together in a most satisfying manner. The mercenaries who have plagued my every step are now imprisoned, accused with the murder of Reiltar, Brunos and Thaldorn. Learn as much as you can about the fate of the mercenaries and then meet me back at Baldur's Gate. I apologize for leaving you here alone, but it was necessary to return to the city so as to take Rieltar's position as chief of operations. If things proceed smoothly I will be a Grand Duke within a few weeks.

@8923  = ~[Message from Sarevok to Zorl 1]Shalak,
I am glad to hear that you were successful in disposing of Zorl. With his identity you should be able to infiltrate more of your kindred into the Merchant's League. Kill Irlentree as soon as possible and then that fop Aldeth.

Your Friend
~
@8924  = ~[Message from Sarevok to Zorl 2]Shalak,
  As long as Aldeth lives he is a great threat to all of us. He is friends with the mercenaries who have been stirring up so much trouble in the south. If he were to confide his fears with them, it could be disastrous. Kill him, soon!

Your Friend
~
@8925  = ~[Message from Sarevok to Zorl 3]Shalak,
It pleases me that you now count Irlentree among your number, but you must kill Aldeth Sashenstar. He is a foppish dilettante, with no skill and little intellect. It confuses me that you have not killed him yet; have your skills withered? Write back soon—when you have killed Aldeth.

Your Friend.
~
@8926  = ~[Message from Sarevok to Rashad the doppelganger]Kizska,
I must commend you for a job well done. Without your careful ministrations, Eltan would have remained my most potent foe. I must now ask for another favor. Some of your brethren are gathering at the sewer entrance to the palace; they are preparing to assassinate Grand Duchess Liia Jannath, and Grand Duke Belt. I need you to assist them in their efforts, for you are the craftiest of your kind. This is the moment I have long waited for, as I hope you have as well. The bloodshed that will result when I declare war on Amn will be most glorious. Meet Krystin and Slythe at the Undercellars, they are my best assassins. There are many access points to the Undercellars through the sewers.

...as the lore goes, many great battles were fought between Corellon and Gruumsh. As Corellon's blood flowed, it mingled with the tears Sehanine shed. And in this mixture of blood and tears, Corellon's children, the Seldarine, were born.

Corellon embodies the highest values of that which is elvenkind. From the gentle aspects of art and poetry to the harsher aspects of war and magic, he is venerated by all the Fair Folk except the drow. Vigilant over his creations, it is told that Corellon will wander the elven lands, observing his people and defending what is theirs.~

Labelas Enoreth is the elven god of longevity and time. At the creation of the Fair Folk, Labelas blessed the elves with long lifespans and decreed that their appearances would not be marked by the passage of time. The lifegiver cooperates with Sehanine in overseeing the lifespan of elves and their growth away from and beyond the mortal realms. He measures the lives of the Fair Folk and decrees when they should be ended, allowing passage to Arvandor. As Lord of the Continuum, Labelas governs the orderly passage of time and guards against those who would alter the path of history. Labelas confers wisdom and teachings on young and old alike, and although he is rarely invoked, the Lifegiver is often praised. The Lifegiver knows the future and past of every elf, faerie, or sylvan creature. Labelas is worshiped by sages, historians, philosophers, librarians, and all those who measure the changes wrought by the passing of years.~

...Sehanine Moonbow is the elven goddess of the moon or, more specifically, the full moon. She governs divinations, omens, and subtle magics and protects against madness. She watches over the dreams of the elves, keeping them from harm while in reverie and sending omens to protect them from future dangers. Sehanine watches over the passage of the elven spirits from the world, and she is protectress of the dead... 

...Alternately called the wife and daughter of Corellon, Sehanine is the mightiest of the female powers in the elven pantheon. Identified with the mystic power of the moon, Sehanine's tears are said to have mingled with Corellon's blood and given life to the elven race.~

@9018  = ~Ancient Lore on Shevarash
By Master E. L. Boyd

Shevarash, who embodies the hatred the Fair Folk hold for the drow, is the elven god of vengeance and military crusades. He is venerated by the elves and half-elves who have suffered the loss of loved ones through violence, particularly those who burn with revenge against the drow, and by those who have sworn to destroy the Spider Queen and the other evil gods of the dark elves. Some elven theologians speculate that Shevarash serves to gather in the bitterness and hatred that has riven the elven race since the Crown Wars, thus keeping the contagious evil of the Spider Queen from spreading to the elven population at large.~

By Master E. L. Boyd

Solonor Thelandira is the elven god of hunting, archery, and survival in wild and harsh places. The Great Archer's prowess with the bow is unmatched by any other power venerated in the realms. Solonor is concerned with the integrity of nature and the balance between exploitation and agriculture on one hand and fallow, wild terrains on the other...

...He instructs the Fair Folk in the art of hiding in and moving through natural foliage so as not to be detected as well as the art of archery and hunting. Solonor is primarily revered by elven and half-elven rangers, hunters, woodsmen, and fighters. In particular, elven hunters appeal to him for better catches of game and elven warriors trapped in hostile territory call on him for aid...~

                    Battle is the test above all
       Bring glory to the Hand of the Seldarine

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every person under my tutelage will be instructed as follows:

You will learn every aspect of each melee weapon I present to you. You will become familiar with the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon and learn how to utilize it effectively.

You will also learn the ways of archery. Patience, discipline, and focus will be your guide. This promise will be your commitment to hitting any target no matter the difficulty.

As a soldier serving the Seldarine's Hand, you will conduct yourself in a proper manner befitting an elf at all times. Disobedience will not be tolerated.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

My Oath

What these values represent is your commitment to the Seldarine's Hand and yourself. 
The promise I make is to hone your skills, both physical and mental, to bring honor to our brothers and sisters.

By Schend and Melka

...Aside from the High Mages, none are certain about the true nature of mythals, no matter how well versed they are in ancient elven lore of old or current debates on magical theory. Many agree that a mythal is alive, and is a huge web of magical forces woven together by magic and the lifeforces of the casters. The mythal is believed to be sustained by the natural mechanisms within and around it, from the wind to the current of a brook or a temperature shift from the energy of sunlight. Given the ties to life and Faerûn, mythals can hardly be common wizardry, no matter what may have been said in the past. The mythals and their magic are tied directly to the Weave, the source of all Torillian magic...~

...contrary to popular belief, our dwarven friends do not exist on a diet of rocks and dirt. I was recently invited to visit their wonderful stronghold, Dorn's Deep. In this architectural wonder, hidden away in one of the most beautiful forests in the North, I entered figuring to be covered in soot from some filthy underground mine unbefitting a high elf of my stature. Much to my surprise, my eyes were instead treated to amazing works of beauty and craftsmanship. Our dwarven friends proceeded to take me on a tour, pointing out each piece in thorough detail. I smiled, impressed that one of the lesser races had such talent in them to create such works. Of course, they paled in comparison to what our elven artisans can do, but this was not the time to point out their flaws...~

@9302  = ~If memory serves me right, he is the dwarven god of scholars, inventors, and explorers.~
@9303  = ~From what I can gather he is the dwarven god of scholars, inventors, and explorers. He's not well known and frowned upon by some of the other gods. They consider him to be a bit... whimsical, I guess you'd say. Anyway, Dugmaren felt that the dwarves should get out and explore the world more.~
@9304  = ~I see. What else can you tell me about this place?~
@9305  = ~~
@9306  = ~Yes, quite right. He's not well known and frowned upon by some of the other gods. They consider him to be a bit... whimsical, I guess you'd say. Anyway, Dugmaren felt that the dwarves should get out and explore the world more.~
@9307  = ~~
@9308  = ~A brilliant architect known as Alkonos the Visionary built this complex. He was a devout follower of Dugmaren and took offense that his deity had no formal temple. So, he petitioned the king and was granted permission to construct one. During the construction he became known as Alkonos the Mad.~
@9309  = ~Why did they call him that?~
@9310  = ~Well, apparently most of the dwarves wanted to just bore a tunnel through this glacier and build a small temple in the mountain on the other side. Alkonos would hear nothing of it. Instead he began construction on a grandiose scale... and here is the result.~

@9326  = ~~
@9327  = ~Oh, they tried... Now, I may not have the lineage exactly right, but it appears that Alkonos was related to the king at the time. He was either a nephew or a cousin. I don't know which. In any case, the king couldn't admit that one of his relatives was a brick shy upstairs. It would be a bad reflection on him.~

This portion of the Deep has been a pleasant surprise, to say the least. Not only do the ancient dwarven deterrents provide me much seclusion for my work, I have gained the ability to have their spirits become my unwilling servants in knowledge. Soon, I will begin my final transcendence, and my ascended existence within this region will ensure that my power is without challenge. My new minions, unable to ever find their peace as long as my thoughts occupy what is left of their minds.

Morning Twenty-Three

A curious experience today. I finally managed to open the door to Jamoth's tomb, and upon entering, I was overcome with fatigue. At first, I felt as though I may have unintentionally sprung a trap, but upon revisiting the tomb later, I discounted that possibility. I felt as though life itself were leaving my body and twisting my coherence. I will need to investigate this room further in the future and exercise caution. I feel as though there may be something within those chambers that would challenge my occupation of these halls.

Morning Twenty-Six

I have given up attempting to open the door to Wyrm's Tooth. I'd hoped to have visited the area to gather some necessities for my rite of passage, but it appears to be impossible to move the door in any way without its key. I know from my readings of the lore scattered about here that the key was placed in or around the dwarven monument outside of the cemetery, but its hiding place appears to be impossible to find in the forge's current state. I'm afraid that without certain resources, the process will render me weaker than I'd originally intended, but I appear to have no choice but to use what I have.~

@9550  = ~HUMANS: Humans are the predominant race in Faerûn. Humans rule most of the significant empires and kingdoms in the realms. They are the most social and tolerant of races, excepting perhaps the halflings. Humans may advance as any class and are also the only race that can dual-class. Humans may not multi-class.

Humans have the following traits:
– +10% Open Locks, +5% Find Traps, +15% Pick Pockets, +10% Move Silently, +5% Hide in Shadows.~
@9551  = ~DWARVES: Dwarves are short and stocky, easily identifiable by their size and shape. They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark hair. Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. They are given to hard work, and care little for most humor. They enjoy beer, ale, mead, but most of all, they love gold. There are four racial divisions of dwarves within the realms: shield dwarves, gold dwarves, wild dwarves, and duergar.

Dwarves have the following traits:
– +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Paralysis/Poison/Death, vs. Rod/Staff/Wand, and vs. Spell, with additional bonuses based on Constitution.

@9552  = ~ELVES: Elves tend to be shorter and slimmer than humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones.

@9553  = ~GNOMES: Kin to dwarves, gnomes are noticeably smaller than their distant cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves. Most have dark tan or brown skin, white hair, and rather large noses. Gnomes have lively and sly senses of humor, especially for practical jokes. They have a love for nature that is only matched by their love for gems and jewelry. There are two racial divisions of gnomes within the realms: rock gnomes and deep gnomes (svirfneblin).

Gnomes have the following traits:
– +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Rod/Staff/Wand and vs. Spell, with additional bonuses based on Constitution.

@9554  = ~HALFLINGS: Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small humans. Their faces are round and broad, and often quite florid. Their hair is typically curly, and the tops of their feet are covered with coarse hair. Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring. They enjoy good living, rough humor, and homespun tales. There are three racial divisions of halflings within the realms: the hairfoot, tallfellow, and stout.

Halflings have the following traits:
– +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Paralysis/Poison/Death, vs. Rod/Staff/Wand, and vs. Spell, with additional bonuses based on Constitution.

@9555  = ~HALF-ELVES: Half-elves are a mix of human and elven blood. They are handsome folk, with good features from each of their parent races.

– 30% resistance against charm and sleep magics.
– Infravision.
– +10% Open Locks, +5% Find Traps, +25% Pick Pockets, +10% Move Silently, +10% Hide in Shadows.~
@9556  = ~FIGHTER: The Fighter is a champion, swords<PRO_MANWOMAN>, soldier, and brawler who lives or dies by <PRO_HISHER> knowledge of weapons and tactics.

Prime Requisites For Dual-Classing: Strength, Dexterity, Wisdom~
@9558  = ~PALADIN: A Paladin is a warrior bold and pure, the exemplar of everything good and true. Like the Fighter, the Paladin is a person of action and combat. However, the Paladin lives for the ideals of righteousness, justice, honesty, piety, and chivalry and strives to be a living example of these virtues so that others may learn from <PRO_HIMHER> as well as gain by <PRO_HISHER> actions.

@9559  = ~CLERIC: The Cleric is a generic priest (of any mythos) who tends to the spiritual needs of a community. Though <PRO_HESHE> is both protector and healer, <PRO_HESHE> is not purely defensive—when evil threatens, the Cleric is well suited to seek it out on its own ground and destroy it. The opposite is true of evil Clerics as well, and there are also many variations in between.

Prime Requisites For Dual-Classing: Dexterity~
@9562  = ~BARD: The Bard is a rogue, but <PRO_HESHE> is very different from the Thief. The Bard's strength is <PRO_HISHER> pleasant and charming personality. With it and <PRO_HISHER> wits, <PRO_HESHE> makes <PRO_HISHER> way through the world. A Bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore; <PRO_HESHE> learns a little bit about everything that crosses <PRO_HISHER> path and is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many Bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

@9563  = ~MAGE: The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, <PRO_HESHE> studies strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of <PRO_HISHER> time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. The Mage studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells; <PRO_HISHER> broad range makes <PRO_HIMHER> well suited to the demands of adventuring.

@9589  = ~LARGE SWORDS: This weapon class allows the character to use Long Swords, Broad Swords, and Scimitars. The Thief is able to take this weapon class, but he is only allowed to use the Long Sword and Broad Sword. The Druid is able to select this class, but is limited to Scimitars alone.~

@9598  = ~OPEN LOCKS: A Thief uses this ability to pick padlocks, door locks, and combination locks.~
@9599  = ~FIND TRAPS: A character uses this ability to find small traps, pit traps, and alarms. It does not find large mechanical traps. Thieves may also use this ability to disarm any traps they find.~
@9600  = ~MOVE SILENTLY: When a character uses this ability, <PRO_HESHE> is able to move without making sound.~
@9601  = ~HIDE IN SHADOWS: Using this ability, a character can disappear into shadows or any other type of concealment—bushes, curtains, crannies, etc.~
@9602  = ~You are to choose your alignment. Your alignment will determine how your character should interact with <PRO_HISHER> environment. Read over each carefully before choosing. If you stray severely from your alignment during the course of the game, there will be consequences.~
@9603  = ~LAWFUL GOOD: Characters of this alignment believe that an orderly, strong society with a well-organized government can work to make life better for the majority of the people. To ensure the quality of life, laws must be created and obeyed. When people respect the laws and try to help one another, society as a whole prospers. Therefore, lawful good characters strive for those things that will bring the greatest benefit to the most people and cause the least harm. An honest and hard-working serf, a kindly and wise king, or a stern but forthright minister of justice are all examples of lawful good people.~
@9604  = ~LAWFUL NEUTRAL: Order and organization are of paramount importance to characters of this alignment. They believe in a strong, well-ordered government, whether that government is a tyranny or a benevolent democracy. The benefits of organization and regimentation outweigh any moral questions raised by their actions. An inquisitor determined to ferret out traitors at any cost or a soldier who never questions his orders are good examples of lawful neutral behavior.~
@9605  = ~LAWFUL EVIL: These characters believe in using society and its laws to benefit themselves. Structure and organization elevate those who deserve to rule as well as provide a clearly defined hierarchy between master and servant. To this end, lawful evil characters support laws and societies that protect their own concerns. If someone is hurt or suffers because of a law that benefits lawful evil characters, too bad. Lawful evil characters obey laws out of fear of punishment. Because they may be forced to honor an unfavorable contract or oath they have made, lawful evil characters are usually very careful about giving their word. Once given, they break their word only if they can find a way to do it legally, within the laws of the society. An iron-fisted tyrant and a devious, greedy merchant are examples of lawful evil beings.~
@9606  = ~NEUTRAL GOOD: These characters believe that a balance of forces is important, but that the concerns of law and chaos do not moderate the need for good. Since the universe is vast and contains many creatures striving for different goals, a determined pursuit of good will not upset the balance; it may even maintain it. If fostering good means supporting organized society, then that is what must be done. If good can only come about through the overthrow of existing social order, so be it. Social structure itself has no innate value to them. A baron who violates the orders of his king to destroy something he sees as evil is an example of a neutral good character.~
@9607  = ~NEUTRAL EVIL: Neutral evil characters are primarily concerned with themselves and their own advancement. They have no particular objection to working with others or, for that matter, going it on their own. Their only interest is in getting ahead. If there is a quick and easy way to gain a profit, whether it be legal, questionable, or obviously illegal, they take advantage of it. Although neutral evil characters do not have the every-man-for-himself attitude of chaotic characters, they have no qualms about betraying their friends and companions for personal gain. They typically base their allegiance on power and money, which makes them quite receptive to bribes. An unscrupulous mercenary, a common thief, and a double-crossing informer who betrays people to the authorities to protect and advance himself are typical examples of neutral evil characters.~
@9608  = ~NEUTRAL: True neutral characters believe in the ultimate balance of forces, and they refuse to see actions as either good or evil. Since the majority of people in the world make judgments, true neutral characters are extremely rare. True neutrals do their best to avoid siding with the forces of either good or evil, law or chaos. It is their duty to see that all of these forces remain in balanced contention. True neutral characters sometimes find themselves forced into rather peculiar alliances. To a great extent, they are compelled to side with the underdog in any given situation, sometimes even changing sides as the previous loser becomes the winner. A true neutral druid might join the local barony to put down a tribe of evil gnolls, only to drop out or switch sides when the gnolls were brought to the brink of destruction. He would seek to prevent either side from becoming too powerful. Clearly, there are very few true neutral characters in the world. ~
@9609  = ~CHAOTIC GOOD: Chaotic good characters are strong individualists marked by a streak of kindness and benevolence. They believe in all the virtues of goodness and right, but they have little use for laws and regulations. They have no use for people who "try to push folk around and tell them what to do." Their actions are guided by their own moral compass which, although good, may not always be in perfect agreement with the rest of society. A brave frontiersman forever moving on as settlers follow in his wake is an example of a chaotic good character.~
@9610  = ~CHAOTIC NEUTRAL: Chaotic neutral characters believe that there is no order to anything, including their own actions. With this as a guiding principle, they tend to follow whatever whim strikes them at the moment. Good and evil are irrelevant when making a decision. Chaotic neutral characters are extremely difficult to deal with. Such characters have been known to cheerfully and for no apparent purpose gamble away everything they have on the roll of a single die. They are almost totally unreliable. In fact, the only reliable thing about them is that they cannot be relied upon! This alignment is perhaps the most difficult to play. Lunatics and madmen tend toward chaotic neutral behavior.~
@9611  = ~CHAOTIC EVIL: These characters are the bane of all that is good and organized. Chaotic evil characters are motivated by the desire for personal gain and pleasure. They see absolutely nothing wrong with taking whatever they want by whatever means possible. Laws and governments are the tools of weaklings unable to fend for themselves. The strong have the right to take what they want, and the weak are there to be exploited. When chaotic evil characters band together, they are not motivated by a desire to cooperate, but rather to oppose powerful enemies. Such a group can be held together only by a strong leader capable of bullying his underlings into obedience. Since leadership is based on raw power, a leader is likely to be replaced at the first sign of weakness by anyone who can take his position away from him by any method. Bloodthirsty buccaneers and monsters of low Intelligence are fine examples of chaotic evil personalities.~

Kell led a peaceful life, fending off the occasional orc or goblin who might wander into his lands. When he died of old age, the druids had no one to pass the blade on to. The oldest of them, Bimon, held on to the scimitar, but never used it in battle. When Bimon and his associates left their grove for an extended period of time, a wandering mercenary robbed the hollow tree of its riches. He carried the scimitar north to the Spine of the World, where he died of exposure.

This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; they cannot be dispelled. The priest can animate 1d6 skeletons or zombies in this manner.~

Under the orders of his commander, Halvan the Dark, he forged ahead through elven forests despite protests and repeated attacks. When he was finally captured by the elves, he stated emphatically that he was free of guilt because he was just following his orders. The elven council deemed that Denell be placed under a High Geas to carry his axe from the Sword Coast of Faerûn to its borders in the east, and from the Great Glacier to Lurien. It took Denell thirty years to complete his task. When he finished, he was an accomplished warrior, weathered and beaten by years on foreign roads. On his way back to his home, he passed by Harrowdale and saw a wooden statue of Halvan the Dark raised proudly in a small town square. With a single-handed blow, he lodged his huge axe into Halvan's forehead. Never breaking stride, he returned to his hut, where he lived out the rest of his days as a reclusive farmer.

They were captured and tortured for the amusement of Tazok, the half-ogre that led the attack. Kivan eventually escaped, but Deheriana did not survive the encounter.

They tried to curb her lunatic behavior, and encouraged her to be content with home and hearth like other halflings. Alora found this unbearably stifling, and left to explore the world. She quickly found herself falling into all sorts of trouble, going to the wrong places and angering the wrong sorts of people. Eventually she found herself in the city of Baldur's Gate, and it was there that she discovered her future profession: thievery. Wealth was never her chief concern; it's just that too many interesting things are behind locked doors. Her unassuming temperament makes it easy for her to hoodwink the authorities, and her sweet nature has saved her from a jail cell numerous times.~

@10185 = ~When asked about his past, MINSC proudly announces that he is a berserker warrior from the nation of Rashemen in the Utter East. He is currently undertaking his dajemma, a ritual journey to manhood, and is seeking adventure and glory in battle. It is also his honor to be the bodyguard of a young Wychalarn of Rasheman named Dynaheir, and if anyone tries to harm her he will beat sense into their heads until they reconsider. He is unsure as to why she has led them to the Sword Coast, but his loyalty is unquestioning. If he serves her well and distinguishes himself in battle he hopes to be accepted into the Ice Dragon berserker lodge upon return to their homeland. So far Minsc considers his most notable experience in the world abroad to be the acquisition of his animal companion 'Boo,' a creature that he claims is a miniature giant space hamster. Apparently such things do exist in the realms, but Minsc has surely taken too many blows to the head. He seems a good-natured fellow, but is all too willing to indulge his berserker nature.~

@10195 = ~When asked about his past, YESLICK quietly states that he was once a member of the dwarven clan Orothiar. For generations they used the iron mine in the center of Cloakwood as their home, but almost a century ago catastrophe struck. As skilled as they are underground, dwarves occasionally make mistakes. One such incident cost them dearly. They apparently breached an underground river and the resulting flood claimed nearly all of the clan. Yeslick was one of the few survivors, and made his way to Sembia to start a new life. There he made the acquaintance of Rieltar, a member of the Iron Throne, and was hired as a personal smith. They became friends, and eventually Yeslick told of his past. This proved to be his undoing, as Rieltar used this information to formulate a plan to expand the Iron Throne power base in the Sword Coast. Rieltar betrayed his supposed friend and forced him to reveal the location of the mines. Yeslick has been imprisoned ever since so as not to reveal the site to others. Now he wishes for nothing but the chance to right the wrongs that have been committed using his ancestral home.~
@10196 = ~When asked about his past, CORAN reveals that he hails from the Forest of Tethir, and while he has great memories of his time there, the serene lifestyle he felt it offered was ultimately not for him. Instead he traveled to the city of Baldur's Gate, dreaming of wealth, power, and respect. With nary a coin to his name, he resorted to thievery, stealing only from those that he felt could spare it and swearing that he would quit once he had enough gold to start his own business. Unfortunately, he soon grew to love his new lifestyle, looking forward to each hair-raising escape, dangerous break-in, or beautiful woman. Occasionally, he would need to leave town for a while, disappearing into the wilderness until things had cooled down and his name was less known. His most recent retreat is apparently the result of a relationship with the female sorceress Brielbara. He sheepishly admits to being caught in the act of seducing a female member of the Knights of the Unicorn and being forced to flee from the violently jealous mage.~
@10197 = ~When asked about his past, AJANTIS announces that he is a squire-paladin of the Order of the Most Radiant Heart, and that he enforces the power and discipline of Helm. He belongs to the noble family of Ilvastarr in Waterdeep, and has studied swordplay under such luminaries as Myrmith Splendon. His skill and devotion apparently brought him to the attention of the paladin Keldorn, one of the most respected of the order, who decided to take Ajantis under his wing as a squire. Recently Ajantis has asked for the honor of becoming a full-fledged member of the order. To accomplish this he has traveled to the Sword Coast, in order to help curtail the increased humanoid activity in the region. If he succeeds in his quest the order will vote on his eligibility for membership. He seems utterly devoted to his mission.~
@10198 = ~When asked about his past, KHALID nervously reveals that he was born and raised in the nation of Calimshan. He does not say much of his parents, but you get the feeling that his merchant father thought little of him, devoting much more attention to Khalid's half brothers. Khalid thus threw himself into the martial pursuits, studying under members of the city militia. He doesn't go into detail on how he met Jaheira, but his adoration of her is obvious. When asked about how he knew Gorion he will only say that they had long been friends, and that many shared acquaintances will mourn his loss with harpsong.~
@10199 = ~When asked about her past, JAHEIRA glares as she speaks. She says that she was born in the Tethyr region to a loyalist of the King Alemander regime, unfortunately during the Tethyrian civil war. Her family was among the nobles targeted by the angry mobs of peasants, and she was only spared because a servant girl took her from their castle before it fell. They fled into the forest of Tethyr and stumbled across an enclave of Druids willing to take the child. Jaheira grew up a very headstrong girl, believing that the only way to protect nature was to have an active role in the world. She seems to have little in common with Khalid, but even though her manner is often confrontational she apparently cares deeply for him. Her admiration of Gorion is obvious, and she plainly states that whomever was responsible for his death will suffer an equal fate.~
@10200 = ~When asked about his past, GARRICK explains that he was part of a celebrated acting troupe called the Dale Wind Troubadours. They traveled the length of the coast from Neverwinter to Amn and often played to Dukes and other nobility. Indeed, few others could afford the cost of a performance when the group was at its peak. Garrick does not speak fondly of this time however, as the direction the group was taking left him dissatisfied with their conduct. He apparently discovered that performances were being used as distractions for thievery and declared he would have nothing to do with it. Rebuffed by his comrades, now he wishes simply to travel and play his music for those that will listen. He seems a bit young and naive, and a touch too ready to take the word of a stranger.~
@10201 = ~When asked about her past, SAFANA spins tale upon tale involving fantastic liaisons with pirate captains, nobles, and royalty of all shapes and sizes. The consistent details seem to be that she grew up in the city of Calimport, surrounded by luxury. Her father was a very influential noble, and though she could have had anything, she apparently found herself too confined by her father's protective arm. She ran away in her early teens with the help of the first mate of the pirate ship "Exzesus," and remained with the crew for several years as they raided up and down the Sword Coast. Eventually she tried to manipulate the captain and found her self in a lot of trouble, escaping when the ship was at port in Baldur's Gate. She has many stories of her escapades after that, but if there is a grain of truth in them you certainly cannot find it.~
@10202 = ~When asked about her past, FALDORN states that she was the child of a Black Raven Uthgardt woman. As an infant she was given over to an enclave of Shadow Druids as an offering, and was thereafter raised according to their beliefs. A splinter group of the main druidic order, Shadow Druids engage in very aggressive protection of nature, often relying on violence to achieve their aims. Faldorn showed great promise as she approached adulthood, and the order decided to send her to the Sword Coast to test her devotion to their ideals. Her ongoing mission is to use any means available to stop the despoiling of nature, no matter the risk or the cost to her life or any other.~
@10203 = ~When asked about her past, BRANWEN reveals that she left her home of Seawolf in the Norheim isles at an early age. She was apparently reviled by her own people for wanting to become a priest, a station reserved exclusively for the men of the village. She harbors no resentment, realizing that her faith must face such tests or be worthless. She traveled the coast, offering her services to local militias, and eventually came into the employ of an adventuring troupe in the Nashkel area. Branwen had no idea that the group was participating in banditry however, and on their first raid she balked at attacking a caravan of unarmed merchants. She rebelled, and a mage named Tranzig turned her to stone in the ensuing fight. Despite the unfavorable outcome, Branwen feels that Tempus views her actions approvingly. To attack those that are unarmed is the basest of villainy.~
@10204 = ~When asked about his past, QUAYLE talks for a good hour about his worship of Baravar Cloakshadow, how he is well on his way to mastering sorcery, and just generally how incredibly smart he is compared to everyone else in the party. He was apparently encouraged to strike out on his own as soon as he came of age because, as he claims, he was simply too gifted to remain in that stifling environment. You get the feeling, however, that no one was terribly broken up over his leaving. He says that he apprenticed in the arts of magic and the worship of Baravar under a gnome named Gifos, though it was not long before this teacher also sent him on his way. Since then, Quayle has wandered the Sword Coast looking for people who were willing to accept his "his wisdom and instruction." It has likely been a long walk.~
@10205 = ~When asked about his past, XAN wistfully speaks of his home in the elven stronghold of Evereska, and his role as a Greycloak. It was apparently decreed that he was to investigate the events of the iron shortage, determine who or what were the causes, and ascertain whether there was a greater threat to the region as a whole. This was definitely not a small task, and he accepted the responsibility with a great deal of dread. You get the feeling, however, that he approaches everything with a great deal of dread. He has devoted his life to improving his mastery of magic and has become a skilled wizard, though this dedication has left him little time to make friends or acquire any other pastimes. He strikes you as very capable, though probably not the best influence on morale.~

@10207 = ~When asked about her past, SKIE bubbles that she is the daughter of Entar Silvershield, one of the Grand Dukes of Baldur's Gate. Her admittedly sheltered life has consisted mostly of learning ballet, history, and languages. Being exceptionally agile she has become a very proficient dancer, though this natural dexterity has mainly allowed her to better sneak off on sojourns away from the estate. She says she finds the nastier areas of Baldur's Gate exciting, though she seems naive about the dangers. On one of her escapades she met up with the debonair Eldoth, and thinks that he can help her live the life of adventure that she craves. She trusts him implicitly, perhaps too much so.~
@10208 = ~When asked about his past, ELDOTH speaks as though his every word should impress and dazzle. He really seems to enjoy talking about himself. He is apparently from the island kingdom of Ruathym, though he left as a teenager for the city of Waterdeep. His natural affinity for song and poetry was honed to perfection while he trained at the musical college of New Olamn, supporting himself with gold borrowed from any one of his given lovers. It would seem that his skill in music is mirrored with his talent in the manipulation of others' emotions. He skims over explaining how he came to leave Waterdeep, but it was apparently the result of an attempted tryst with Aleena Palidinstar. Piergeiron, lord of the city, discovered that his daughter was being used by a manipulative dilettante and likely became quite furious. Eldoth probably had to flee the city, deciding it was time to use his bard skills elsewhere.~
@10209 = ~When asked about his past, XZAR has very few coherent things to say. His desire to determine the cause of the iron shortage seems benevolent enough, but his motives remain unclear. His ramblings seem disjointed, but his faculties are obviously in good enough order for him to be adept at magic. He mutters something about how he and his associate Montaron are in the employ of a powerful group, but when pressed for details he gets extremely agitated and does not speak for some time. He is obviously at least partially insane, and the network that would hire him must be dark indeed.~
@10210 = ~When asked about his past, MONTARON openly threatens you with bodily harm. He seems quite dangerous, and more than willing to engage in gratuitous violence. It would appear that he cares little for life, including his own. He works grudgingly with Xzar, even though he obviously despises the man. Whoever their employers are, they must be powerful indeed. These two would likely kill each other without a presence over their heads preventing it. Montaron might be willing to discuss the whole matter with you, but you get the feeling that you probably would not wake up the next morning.~

Tiax unquestioningly believes that he is destined to rule the world, and his fervor makes him blind to the ridiculous nature of the goal. He seems harmless enough for now.~
@10214 = ~When asked about his past, KAGAIN stresses that the questioner should just mind their own business if they want to keep their teeth. It is apparent that he runs a rather shady mercenary company and that he is quite obsessed with wealth, but any information beyond this he is content to keep to himself.~
@10215 = ~When asked about her past, SHAR-TEEL has very little to say. From the little she speaks of it can be gleaned that she is an orphan. She also seems to harbor an intense dislike for Flaming Fist mercenaries, as well as an obvious disrespect for men in general. She seems to have something to prove, and likely her childhood was not of storybook quality.~
@10216 = ~When asked about his past, EDWIN sneers that he has no intention of revealing such information and that it is none of your business. He further states that you are lucky enough to simply share his company, and then mutters something about leaving whenever he wishes. He obviously cares little for the camaraderie of others, and seems to take more pleasure in speaking to himself than in interacting with the party. His attire brazenly displays the colors of the Red Wizards of Thay, though why a member of that organization would come so far west is puzzling. Edwin does not seem forthcoming with any information.~
@10217 = ~When asked about her past, VICONIA reveals (quite proudly) that she is a dark elf from the Underdark city of Menzoberranzan. She says very little about her reasons for leaving that sunless realm, though separations of such a nature are never gentle. She does claim to no longer worship the spider goddess Lolth; a change that even you know is often fatal. Her new faith is in the night goddess Shar, an appropriate choice for a drow, though this is not a firm indication that she has given up the brutal ways of her people. She finds the laws of the surface world quaint and more than a little strange, but this is simply because of her lack of experience. Likewise she seems a bit naive about how her race is viewed by surface-dwellers. Many will not give her the chance she seems to expect, and even being seen with her may affect how people think of you. You know that as a drow, she has resistance to magic, both beneficial and harmful.~

Acting as your father, he has raised you on a thousand tales of heroes and monsters, lovers and infidels, battles and tragedies. However, one story was always left untold: that of your true heritage. You have been told that you are an orphan, but your past remains largely unknown.~

@10427 = ~Yeah, get out of here... before I get angry. Scuttle around the palace with the rest of Marketh's puny gang. Heh.~
@10428 = ~That's it. I'm already tired of your big mouth. Get ready to be crushed, pipsqueak.~
@10429 = ~Heh. Fine, tough guy. If you're looking for Ilmadia, you can find her to the east. Follow the edge of the lake to her house.~
@10430 = ~Fine, paladin. Have it your way. Maiden Ilmadia is to the east. Follow the edge of the lake to her house. By the way, if you start getting any funny ideas in your head, we'll break your bones one by one, holy warrior.~
@10431 = ~I think you're probably looking for Brother Perdiem, but if you really want to talk to her, Maiden Ilmadia is to the east. Follow the edge of the lake to her house. Don't get any funny ideas in your head, black vicar.~

@10446 = ~In Ilmater's absence, we serve only Poquelin! His word supercedes the gospel. Now, blasphemers, you will suffer under the blade of the Voice!~

@10556 = ~How did you make him angry?~

@10579 = ~I... I spoke to him in drow. It was wrong of me.~
@10580 = ~I enter battle tomorrow with a heavy heart, knowing I may well not survive. Such is life, and many a fool has risked as much for less gold than I will be paid. Still, I cannot bear the possibility of losing the treasures I have worked so hard for. To prevent this, I write this note to myself as a reminder in case I suffer an injury that would impair my faculties. Any battle against a mage always carries such a risk.

Quenash, my beautiful fallen saint, holds my cloak as a reminder of me. My helm I will trust only to my guile in hiding it. It rests where people rest, in a building that may as well have been named for the purpose. The cloak should be with it, but that would only be expected. I shall not make their theft easy.~
@10581 = ~Well, it certainly doesn't warrant Marketh beating you. Do you want me to take care of him for you?~
@10582 = ~Yes. It was wrong. Drow is gutter speech.~
@10583 = ~No! Please, don't. Whatever he's done, you must promise me you won't hurt him.~
@10584 = ~Okay. I promise I won't hurt him.~
@10585 = ~Sorry, I can't promise you anything.~
@10586 = ~No way. He's dead. Have no doubts about it, when I find him, it's over.~
@10587 = ~I should have seen it coming. I abused Malavon constantly while he was growing up. When Revered Brother Poquelin and his lieutenants met with my people, I slighted Marketh. I wouldn't speak to him because he was male. Instead, I spoke with Maiden Ilmadia. After long discussion, our city could find no reason to ally with Poquelin.~
@10588 = ~Unlike the rest of my people, Malavon wanted to join with the Revered Brother. I discovered this, so he abducted me and took me to Marketh for "safekeeping." They eventually found out anyway. Now Poquelin is planning some sort of assault on my former home. And I... I am left here with Marketh.~
@10589 = ~Squire Melvin~
@10590 = ~Do you want me to take care of Marketh for you?~
@10591 = ~Thank you. I understand why you're here. It has something to do with Poquelin, doesn't it? Listen, I know this will sound crazy, but I'm sure that Marketh could be a better person somehow if he could just get out of here.~
@10592 = ~[no text]~
@10593 = ~If you want to break up Poquelin's army, you'll need each of the lieutenant's badges. Marketh has one. They open an invisible barrier at the back of the fallen temple. Brother Perdiem and his undead fellows watch over it. Whatever you need to do, please... don't hurt Marketh. It's not his fault that he does bad things...~
@10594 = ~If I did, he'd kill me. I have fallen from favor with Lloth. I have no magic, and no weapons. Marketh is an accomplished fighter. I would never be able to escape. Don't try to confront him, either. He has a ring that allows him to teleport around Lower Dorn's Deep at his will.~
@10595 = ~Farewell, Ginafae.~
@10596 = ~~
@10597 = ~Well, then... could you steal the ring?~
@10598 = ~Actually, I've already had a copy of that ring made. Here you go.~

@10601 = ~Qar Jysstev~
@10602 = ~Hmm... that is a problem. Maybe I'll think of something. Farewell.~
@10603 = ~Oh yes, that will certainly do. Oh... you must have had Norl make this. That poor little man. I never really cared about the suffering of others until I had to suffer. I know that if I ever get out of here, I can't expect anyone to show charity towards me... not after what my race has done.~
@10604 = ~Quickly, now, you must leave. Marketh must not suspect. Come back in a day and the deed should be done.~
@10605 = ~Be careful, Ginafae. Farewell.~

@10625 = ~[no text]~
@10626 = ~We finally spoke with Arundel, the Archdruid of Kuldahar. The old man explained why he had sent for help from Easthaven. It seems that there are evil forces stirring in the mountains nearby. He believes this evil is somehow affecting the weather in the pass, causing the ring of warmth that centers around Kuldahar's Great Oak to slowly shrink. He also believes that the evil is behind the numerous monster sightings and the mysterious abductions about town. We have agreed to help discover the source of the evil by investigating a nearby vale. Apparently, there have been rumors of undead stirring within some ancient crypts located within this "Vale of Shadows." We are to travel to the Vale, discover if there is a connection between the undead and the disturbances in Kuldahar, and then return to Arundel with whatever information we find.~
@10627 = ~[no text]~
@10628 = ~I could, but he'd notice immediately.~
@10629 = ~Actually, I've already had a copy of that ring made. Here you go.~
@10630 = ~Hmm. That is a problem. I'll see what I can do.~
@10631 = ~If you're going to hurt him, I won't help you. It's as simple as that.~

@10655 = ~Please help us! Send Shikata and his thugs back to the plane they came from. If you do not, Marketh and his salamanders will work my people into the grave!~
@10656 = ~Thank you for rescuing me from the mines. Now that Shikata is dead, we are one step closer to saving our people. Unfortunately, I must ask for your aid once again.~
@10657 = ~Do not hesitate to ask. If you have need, I will support you.~
@10658 = ~Sure. What do you need?~
@10659 = ~Again? Fine. What is it now?~
@10660 = ~Sorry. I can't help you anymore. Farewell.~
@10661 = ~I hope that your courage is as remarkable as your charity. By communing with the stones, we have learned that a pack of umber hulks is headed this way. They are likely to find our camp within two surface days. We need you to help defend us.~

@10663 = ~On second thought, that sounds dangerous. I don't think I can help you.~

@10666 = ~Sorry. I'm not helping you. Farewell.~

@10758 = ~Not that it's any of your business, but I suppose you're better company than the giants... My superior has requested that we dismantle the Great Forge. We are using the metal to construct a longboat of immense proportions.~
@10759 = ~When the ship is finished, the giants will row it down the great lava rapids just beyond that rock. From there, they will pick up speed and ram into the cavern wall roughly a quarter of a league away. When the wall breaks, the lava will pour into the large, low cavern beyond.~
@10760 = ~In that cavern lies the dark elf city of Rilauven. Drow always flaunt their resistance to magic. Well, we'll see just how resistant they are to lava and giant, two hundred pound broad swords. Poquelin wants to make sure our rear guard isn't crushed by those black-skinned schemers.~
@10761 = ~Besides that, my job is pretty straightforward. In our spare time, Malavon and I are attempting to use Saablic Tan's Red Wizard formula to create black unicorns. Once I locate the herd that occasionally mills around the Severed Hand, it should be simple enough to lure a few my way with my virginity and the help of a necklace that masks my "true nature."~
@10762 = ~It just goes to show that Poquelin was right. There's nothing that can't be corrupted in some way. "Hail Ilmater!" and all that. Ha!~
@10763 = ~My, oh my. You are one... black... hearted... bitch.~
@10764 = ~You're a traitor to Tel'Quessir, Ilmadia. How could you stray so far from the moral foundation of our people?~
@10765 = ~I always thought you pointy-eared folk were a bit weak in the head. Now I have my proof.~
@10766 = ~Excellent! You have a fine operation going here. Poquelin must be very pleased.~
@10767 = ~Ha ha! Yeah, "Hail Ilmater!" That's a good one. Oh! I think it's time for you to hand over your badge now.~
@10768 = ~Oh, shut up. What am I supposed to do, listen to our elders and watch as the greatest race on Toril drifts into the western sea? To the Abyss with the Retreat, the houses, and the Seldarine, for all I care. And, since you appear to not approve of my life and how I live it, to the Abyss with *you*.~
@10769 = ~He's relatively pleased, yes. Progress was slow when King Thargren was in charge. After a pack of water elementals and salamanders killed him, Poquelin put me in charge of the fire giant clan. I've provided the tactical knowledge the fire giants lack.~
@10770 = ~The salamanders are a crafty bunch, though. They recognize that without my leadership, they could probably rally the elementals against the fire giants. They try to sneak over here to kill me, using houses for cover. That's why I ordered the fire giants to crush them. We had to put metal plates in the ground to prevent the earth elementals from killing me when I slept.~
@10771 = ~I thought the salamanders were your allies. Don't they drive the slaves in the mines and Durdel Anatha?~
@10772 = ~Sorry, friend. I can't give it to you. My work here is too important to give up. Now that I've refused, I'm going to assume that your intent is to take it by force. Please forgive me if I don't wait for you to make the first move.~
@10773 = ~Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think I'm going to let that happen. You seem like trouble to me.~
@10774 = ~*Some* of the salamanders are our allies. Shikata isn't powerful enough to bully them all into obedience, so a faction of salamanders broke off. They realized that the dismantling of the forge would cause the portals to the Elemental Plane of Fire to be destroyed. If that occurred, the salamanders would have to compete for heat.~
@10775 = ~Interesting. I'm going to go now, Ilmadia. Farewell.~
@10776 = ~Thanks for the information, but now it's time for you to meet your ancestors in Arvandor.~

Dual-classing is a significant change to your character. Please be sure you have read and understand the following, as well as the description given in the manual.

Dual-classing is an ability that only humans have. It is the process by which you stop advancing in your current class and begin advancing in a second class. You will retain the benefits and abilities of the first class at its current level, but from then on you will only gain experience in the second.

In order to become dual-classed, you must be of at least 2nd level in your current class. Your character must have scores of 15 or higher in the prime requisites of your current class and scores of 17 or more in the prime requisites of the class you wish to change to. Some classes cannot be combined due to alignment conflicts or inherent restrictions. Within Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, all resulting mixes must be viable multi-class combinations as well.

Dual-class characters have much the same requirements as multi-class characters. You must abide by the restrictions of the individual classes. For example: A Mage combination cannot cast spells while wearing armor, a Thief combination cannot use thieving skills while wearing armor other than leather, and a Cleric or Druid combination cannot use weapons that their ethos does not allow.

When you gain a level, you will have the option to change to a second class, provided you have the prerequisites and do not have any alignment conflicts. Your first class becomes "inactive," and you begin again at 1st level with 0 experience points in your second class. From then on, you progress as a single-classed character in your new class. ONCE YOU HAVE CHANGED TO A SECOND CLASS, YOU CANNOT GO BACK TO THE FIRST. Your first class will forever remain at its current level.

You will be unable to use the abilities of your first class until you have attained ONE LEVEL HIGHER in your new class. For example: If you were a 10th-level Mage and switched to a Fighter, you would not be able to use your Mage abilities again until you reached 11th level as a Fighter.~
@10812 = ~Hmm. Where can I find this man?~
@10813 = ~~
@10814 = ~I don't know. I'm not sure I want to know, either. Every once in a while, when Marketh comes here, I have the urge to jump up and hit him. I thought about doing the same thing when Poquelin came here. As soon as I did, he grabbed my face and looked right into my eyes. It was like he knew.~
@10815 = ~Interesting. Farewell, Norl.~
@10816 = ~Certainly. I would leap at the chance. Just tell me what I need to do.~
@10817 = ~Marketh has a ring that he uses to teleport all over Dorn's Deep. If you could make a copy of that ring, we might be able to switch it and trap him.~
@10818 = ~Never mind, Norl. Farewell.~
@10819 = ~I know that ring well, but not that well. If I could get hold of the ring itself, I could do it. Otherwise, I don't believe I'd be able to make an accurate copy.~
@10820 = ~Well, I do have a drawing of him that I got from two sculptors. It shows his ring in great detail. Would that do the trick?~
@10821 = ~Hmm. That is a problem. I'll try to figure something out. Farewell.~
@10822 = ~Yes... yes... that will do nicely. This ring will be my greatest piece yet...~
@10823 = ~Sure. Here you go. I'll come back in a while to pick the ring up.~

This spell is similar to the 7th-level Spell Turning, which causes the spells cast against the wizard to rebound upon the original caster. This affects a total of 4 spell levels—including spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities—but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard as well as area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud. This spell will only affect up to 4th-level spells, but as long as there are levels remaining then the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be reflected while canceling the spell turning. Still don't know how this will work with Dispel Magic.~

By McComb and Pryor

An elite group of elven fighter mages, the bladesingers are dedicated to the defense of the elven nation, and many of them journey back to Faerûn to help defend those elves who stayed behind or have yet to join the Retreat.

Bladesingers are terrifying weapons experts and spellcasters. On Evermeet, they are organized into small warrior lodges, each specializing in a different weapon. They are even more dedicated to the ancient ways and styles of dress than other silver elves. They often tattoo themselves with old runes and symbols, and their armor and weapons are all of great antiquity and beautiful craftsmanship.~

(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell enables the priest to imbue 1 creature with the ability to regenerate. This regeneration will heal any wounds and even regenerate lost limbs. The creature effected will regain 1 Hit Point per round for every 2 levels of the caster. The effect lasts for 1 round per level of the caster or until dispelled. For example a 14th level priest would regenerate 7 Hit Points per round for 14 rounds.~

Where they attained the weapons of the alliance is still a mystery, but I believe in my heart that it was not through the dwarves. We have succeeded in stifling their advances but it won't hold for long. We have taken severe casualties and our forces are dwindling rapidly.

Negotiations are over with our former friends. We are now in open conflict with them. As much as I love my father, I blame him for this. Ever since we found the weapons in the horde's possession, father has been completely irrational. Any discussions had with our former friends ended in bitter accusations and resentment. He adamantly believes that the dwarves betrayed us and listens to nothing they have to say in their defense.

Am I the only one who sees that both sides are going to die horribly if this continues? Father does not see reason in putting aside hostilities with the dwarves so that we may unite against our common enemy. I spoke to him of going to Dorn's Deep to approach our old friends. He lashed out at me in anger and sent me out of the astrolabe.

I now make preparations to leave home and ride to Dorn's Deep myself. I know in my heart what must be done and this is the only way. Perhaps I have more of my father's stubbornness than I thought.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total number of spell levels equal to half the level of the caster. It includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest and area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud.

As long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.

This spell will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but it will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

@11454 = ~I tried to get to the root of the problem, to discover the treacherous party responsible for the pestilence of mistrust and open aggression. I swore to Torm that I would not allow the dwarves and elves to wage war against each other. This was my folly, my downfall.~
@11455 = ~In my pride, I believed I could divert the massive rivers of suspicion and hatred that flowed between the races. I was wrong. They would not hear my words. Desperate to see that my vow was not broken, I threw myself between the charging dwarven warriors and the stalwart elven archers.~
@11456 = ~So many arrows pierced my body, so many dwarven feet broke my bones. I did not feel them. But my soul... my soul felt the weight of Duty's Bond. I could not ascend to judgment. Weighted down by my guilt, I remained here, among the dead.~
@11457 = ~Now my guilt is spread upon the table before me. Hungry, it consumes me in an eternal Holy Vigil. It will never be satiated. Despite this, I must obey. I must eternally serve the churches of the triad: Tyr, Torm and Ilmater. It is my duty. I will wait here until time itself shatters my shackles against the Spine of the World.~

@11473 = ~Unless I have direct proof that they do not represent Ilmater, I must serve them without question. Brother Harken can see you through my eyes now. He is commanding me to attack you. I must obey him. It is my duty.~
@11474 = ~Tell me. If your words ring false, nothing shall keep me from my duty.~
@11475 = ~It was Nym, a dark elven merchant. He stole the artifacts and sold them to the goblins attacking the Hand of the Seldarine. *That's* why the elves thought the dwarves sold the artifacts to the goblins.~
@11476 = ~I can sense the truth in your words. I have also heard the words of Harken. This armor was forged to serve man. My soul was forged to serve Torm. Now that I know the truth about the dwarven artifacts, now that I know that Harken does not serve Ilmater, I am free. Now... I can use my own voice to thank you.~
@11477 = ~I will always remember what you have done for me. If you would do me one last service, please take my remains to one of the temples of the Trinity for burial. It would mean a great deal to me... knowing that I was buried on holy ground. Thank you. Farewell.~
@11478 = ~You think I'm scared just because you're some sort of tribal leader? Get out of my way before I have to throw you and your brothers all over this cave.~
@11479 = ~Stand aside, fiend. You'll not prevent me from dispensing justice on those who have perpetrated malfeasance under the guise of righteousness.~

@11481 = ~I will enjoy hearing the bravado burn out of your blackening lungs, small one. YAH!~

The shaft is crafted to resemble an elven femur and wrapped in tanned elf skin. A stout chain connects the shaft to a spiked ball. The entire creation is forged out of meteoric iron.

@11581 = ~Alamion +3~
@11582 = ~This long sword is part of a matched pair of weapons, the other being the short sword Malamion. Alamion's blade is slightly thinner than a typical long sword blade and features a thin fuller down the center. Acid-etched snowflake patterns are scattered along the length of the blade, most of them concentrated towards the hilt. The hilt of the sword is made of bronze sandwiched between two off-white pieces of ivory carved to show clouds unleashing winds and snow. The grip is covered with mother-of-pearl lashed securely into place with bronze wire. The pommel of the weapon is a solid bronze globe with the snowflake lozenge of Auril etched into the bottom.

The full history of this blade and its brother have been well documented. Roughly two hundred years ago, a wizard from Shannath named Obren the Left-Handed was hired to make a pair of swords for the glory of Auril. Obren reluctantly did so, producing Alamion ("Frost Daddy") and Malamion ("Frost Baby") over a five year period. After a dispute about Obren's fee, priests of Auril tried to take the sword from him by force. The exact outcome of the battle is unclear, but Obren's swords did not end up in the hands of Auril's faithful. Thirty years later, a warrior named Berdino in Procampur bragged that he had a blade that could kill demons in a single strike. Berdino was found dead on the shore two tendays later, the victim of many poisoned crossbow bolts.

The new owner of Alamion was a vain, egotistical thief called Pellas the Fair. Pellas had acquired Malamion, quite by accident, fourteen years earlier and strongly desired its brother when he learned of its existence. Pellas held onto the swords until he died at the hands of a paladin named Garijon Renold of Torm. Garijon found the blades invaluable in his battles against the fiery denizens of the outer planes, and the two swords were passed on for generations from paladin to paladin.

Heleban of Ithmong, a paladin of Tyr, was the last warrior known to have used the swords. His battles against slavers and pirates on the Sword Coast are believed to have brought him to an untimely end.

(Invocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a silver-hued, partially ethereal lance shaped in the form of an alicorn (a unicorn horn). The caster chooses a target, and the alicorn lance instantaneously fires at it, inflicting 3d6 points of piercing damage with a Save vs. Spell for half. Although the alicorn lance dissipates after it strikes, it always leaves a silvery radiance around the target that makes it easier to see and hit, giving it a -2 penalty to its Armor Class for 3 rounds.~
@12140 = ~Armor
(Conjuration)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were scale mail armor (AC 6). It is cumulative with Dexterity and, in the case of Fighter/Mages, with the shield bonus. The Armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and does not prevent spellcasting. It lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out.~
@12141 = ~Burning Hands
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 7-ft. cone with 90-deg. arc
Saving Throw: 1/2

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from <PRO_HISHER> fingertips. The flame jets are 7 ft. in length and spread out in a horizontal arc of about 90 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of effect suffers 1d3 Hit Points of damage, plus 2 points per level of experience of the spellcaster, to a maximum of 1d3 + 20 points of fire damage. If the target saves vs. Spell, they only take half damage.~
@12142 = ~Mirror Image
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 6-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes two to eight duplicates of <PRO_HIMHER>self to come into being around <PRO_HIMHER>. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which ones are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until struck. The images shift from round to round so that an enemy must first hit every image before being able to hit the wizard.~
@12143 = ~Shadow Door
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 5
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality <PRO_HESHE> has darted aside and can flee, totally invisible (as per the Improved Invisibility spell), for the spell duration. A true seeing spell, a gem of seeing, or similar magical means can discover the wizard.~
@12144 = ~Wraithform
(Alteration, Illusion)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of <PRO_HISHER> gear become insubstantial. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. The wizard also gains a 25% Magic Resistance. While in wraith form the caster is unable to cast spells.~
@12145 = ~Dispel Magic
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Dispel Magic removes magical effects upon anyone within the area of effect. This includes magically created items and the effects of spells and potions. It does not, however, affect magical items themselves.~
@12146 = ~Minor Globe Of Invulnerability
(Abjuration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e. the area of effect of any such spell does not include the area of the Minor Globe Of Invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere with no penalty. The globe can be brought down by a successful Dispel Magic spell.~
@12147 = ~Non-Detection
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: 7 turns/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By casting this spell, the wizard makes the creature touched undetectable by divination magics such as Clairvoyance and the Detect spells. It also prevents spells that reveal hidden or invisible creatures, such as Invisibility Purge, from working on the target.~
@12148 = ~Protection From Evil
(Abjuration)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, a magical barrier forms around the recipient and moves with <PRO_HIMHER>. The barrier has three effects: First, it bestows a +2 bonus to the recipient's Armor Class and Saving Throws against attacks from evil-aligned opponents; second, it prevents summoned fiends from attacking the recipient; third, it makes the recipient immune to charm-based spells or effects (e.g. Charm Person, Charm Person or Mammal, Domination, and so on).~
@12149 = ~Protection From Normal Missiles
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard bestows total invulnerability to non-magical hurled and launched missiles such as arrows, bolts, bullets, darts, throwing axes, and throwing daggers. Note, however, that this spell does not convey any protection from such magical attacks as Fireball, Lightning Bolt, or Magic Missile, nor does it protect against magical missiles such as arrows +1.~
@12150 = ~Protection From Petrification
(Abjuration)

Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1

Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This arcane spell instills courage in the spell's recipients, raising their morale to maximum. The recipients' morale will gradually reset to normal as the duration runs out. If the recipients are under the effects of magical fear, the effect is negated.~
@12152 = ~Flame Arrow
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell enables the caster to hurl fiery arrows at one of <PRO_HISHER> enemies. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. The caster can fire one bolt for every five experience levels (two bolts at 10th level, three at 15th level, etc.).~
@12153 = ~Ghost Armor
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a magical field of force with the strength of plate armor (AC 3). It is cumulative with Dexterity effects and, in the case of Fighter/Mages, with the shield bonus. The Ghost Armor spell does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, and does not prevent spellcasting. It lasts until dispelled or until the duration runs out.~
@12154 = ~Grease
(Conjuration)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 6-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

A Grease spell covers the ground with a slippery layer of a fatty, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell every round or have their movement rate slowed to a crawl as long as they are in the area of effect. Those who successfully save can move normally.~
@12155 = ~Melf's Acid Arrow
(Conjuration)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round + 1 round/3 levels
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a magical arrow that speeds unerringly to its target. The arrow has no attack or damage bonus, but it inflicts 2d4 points of acid damage immediately and again at the end of the round. (There is no splash damage.) For every three levels the caster has achieved, the acid lasts another 1 round, inflicting another 2d4 points of damage at the end. So from 3rd to 5th level, the acid lasts 2 rounds (dealing 6d4 total damage); from 6th to 8th level, the acid lasts for 3 rounds (dealing 8d4 total damage); etc.~
@12156 = ~Monster Summoning I

With the casting of this spell the wizard summons 1d4 3rd-level monsters. These appear within spell range and can be commanded to attack the caster's opponents until the spell duration expires or the monsters are slain.~
@12159 = ~Clairvoyance
(Divination)

Level: 3
Range: Special
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The Clairvoyance spell empowers the wizard to see in <PRO_HISHER> mind the geographical features and buildings of the region <PRO_HESHE> is currently exploring. It extends to a great range, but cannot reveal creatures or their movements. This spell does not function indoors or underground.~
@12160 = ~Detect Evil

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: Instant

Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: Special
Area of Effect: 1 item
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is memorized, the caster can identify the magical properties of one item in the caster's inventory. Go to the description of an unidentified item and press the Identify button to use the spell. The chance of identifying the item is 100%. The spell identifies the item's name, what it does, and if it is cursed.~
@12162 = ~Infravision
(Divination)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature

@12163 = ~Detect Invisibility
(Divination)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When the wizard casts Detect Invisibility, <PRO_HESHE> dispels enemy invisibility and reveals any hidden foes in the area of effect (i.e. Thieves using Stealth).

Note: If an invisible enemy enters the area of effect after the spell has already been cast, the creature will remain invisible.~
@12164 = ~Know Alignment
(Divination)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

A Know Alignment spell enables the caster to read a creature's aura. Evil creatures will glow red, neutrals blue, and good creatures will glow green for a brief period. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Alignment spell.~
@12165 = ~Charm Person
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person receives a Save vs. Spell to avoid the effect.

If the spell recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Save vs. Spell, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster can give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if Dispel Magic is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the charm spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> was charmed.~
@12166 = ~Confusion
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes confusion in enemy creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. Enemy creatures within the area of effect are allowed Saving Throws vs. Spell with a -2 penalty. Those who succeed are unaffected; those who fail either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and reacts accordingly.~
@12167 = ~Confusion
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes confusion in enemy creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. Enemy creatures within the area of effect are allowed Saving Throws vs. Spell with a -2 penalty. Those who succeed are unaffected; those who fail either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell. Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and reacts accordingly.~
@12168 = ~Dire Charm
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell is similar to the Charm Person spell. However, the affected creature will attack anyone <PRO_HESHE> perceives as hostile without being commanded to. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the effect.

Dire Charm is limited in the same manner as Charm Person. The spell can affect any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, lizard men, orcs, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not.~
@12169 = ~Friends
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

A Friends spell causes the wizard to temporarily gain 5 points of Charisma. While cast, those who view the caster tend to be very impressed and will generally make an effort to help <PRO_HIMHER>.~
@12170 = ~Hold Person
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures immobile for 6 rounds or longer. Specifically, it affects the targeted enemy and up to 3 hostile creatures within 20 ft. of it. Affected creatures must be living bipedal humans, demihumans, and humanoids of man size or smaller, including dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, lizard men, orcs, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the effect.

Paralyzed creatures are helpless and cannot dodge or defend themselves from attacks. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@12171 = ~Luck
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 2
Range: 15 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell gains extraordinary luck for the next 3 rounds, receiving a +1 bonus to <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throws, attack rolls, and minimum damage/healing rolls as well as +5% to all thieving skills. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and a flaming long sword that deals 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d3 fire damage will deal 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d2 fire damage instead.~
@12172 = ~Sleep
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 9-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Sleep causes a comatose slumber to come upon 2d4 Hit Dice of creatures (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects). Monsters with 5 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. Though it's not the stuff of which legends are made, attacks against magically sleeping opponents never miss—although they will awaken after the first hit.~
@12173 = ~Agannazar's Scorcher
(Evocation)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 2-ft. by 40-ft. jet.
Saving Throw: Special

Upon casting this spell a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips and shoots toward a target of the caster's choice. The flame causes 3d6 points of fire damage to the target, no Saving Throw allowed—anyone in the flame's path takes 2d8, but they are allowed a Save vs. Spell for half damage.~
@12174 = ~Chromatic Orb
(Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates a 4-inch-diameter sphere that can be hurled unerringly to its target. The orb's effects depend on the level of the wizard:

– 1: Inflicts 1d4 magic damage and blinds the target for one round.
– 2: Inflicts 1d6 fire damage and inflicts pain upon the victim (-1 penalty to Armor Class and THAC0) for one round.
– 3: Inflicts 1d8 magic damage and burns the victim for 1d3 fire damage.
– 4: Inflicts 1d10 magic damage and blinds the target for 4 rounds.
– 5 to 6: Inflicts 1d12 magic damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds.
– 7 and up: Inflicts 2d8 magic damage and paralyzes the victim for 13 rounds.

A successful Save vs. Spell negates all effects.~
@12175 = ~Cloudkill
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 8-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice and force creatures with 5 or 6 Hit Dice to roll Saving Throws vs. Poison with -4 penalties or be slain. Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th level (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect.~
@12176 = ~Cone of Cold
(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 20-ft. cone with 60-deg. arc

(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

Fireball is one of the reasons that wizards gained acceptance in the field of adventuring. To cast it, the wizard points <PRO_HISHER> finger and speaks the range at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and blossoms into a fireball, delivering fire damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it: 1d6 points of damage for each level of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10d6). Those who roll successful a Save vs. Spell manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, taking only half damage.~
@12178 = ~Ice Storm
(Evocation)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Path of bolt
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of energy that inflicts 1d6 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster to each creature within its area of effect (maximum damage of 10d6). A successful Save vs. Spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). When the lightning bolt intersects with a wall, it will rebound until it reaches its full length—hitting the same enemy multiple times, or even members of the caster's own party.~
@12180 = ~Magic Missile
(Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Casting Magic Missile, one of the most popular 1st-level spells, creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. For every two extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile—<PRO_HESHE> has two at 3rd level, three at 5th level, four at 7th level, and a maximum of five missiles at 9th level.~
@12181 = ~Stinking Cloud

Stinking Cloud creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 40 ft. away from the wizard. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful Save vs. Poison or be reeling and fall unconscious for the next round; unconscious creatures do not awaken when struck. Those who make successful Saving Throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save every round.~

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

The wall of fire spell brings forth an immobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of shimmering color—violet or reddish-blue. The spell creates either an opaque sheet of flame up to one 20-ft. square per level of the spellcaster, or a ring with a radius of up to 10 ft. + 5 ft. per two levels of experience of the wizard. In either form, the wall of fire is 20 ft. high.

The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the caster. The wall inflicts 2d6 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, upon any creature passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. The wall lasts for one round per level.~

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 8-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands, similar to spider webs but much larger and tougher. Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a Save vs. Spell every round. If failed, the creature is paralyzed for one round. If the Saving Throw is successful, then the creature can move normally.~

Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or are turned; they cannot be dispelled. The caster can animate 1d6 skeletons or zombies in this manner.~

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Neg.

When the caster completes this spell, a blue glow encompasses <PRO_HISHER> hand. This energy attacks the life force of any creature upon which the wizard makes a successful melee attack. The touched creature must make a Save vs. Spell or suffer 1d4 points of cold damage and receive a -1 THAC0 penalty for 1 turn after being struck.

An undead creature suffers no damage or to-hit penalty from Chill Touch, but will be affected by panic for 2 turns unless it successfully makes a Save vs. Spell.~

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to <PRO_HISHER> own. The target creature suffers 1d4 magic damage, while the wizard gains 1d4 Hit Points. If the wizard goes over <PRO_HISHER> maximum Hit Point total with this spell, <PRO_HESHE> loses them after 1 turn. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.~
@12190 = ~Vampiric Touch
(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the caster successfully touches an opponent in melee, the opponent loses 1d6 Hit Points for every two caster levels, to a maximum drain of 6d6 for a 12th-level caster. These Hit Points are added to the caster's total, with any Hit Points over the caster's normal maximum total treated as temporary bonus Hit Points. The temporary Hit Points last for 1 hour. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.~

Level: 1
Range: 12 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 29-ft. cone with 90-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a vivid, fan-shaped spray of clashing colors to spring forth from the caster's hand. Creatures within the area are affected in order of increasing distance from the wizard. All creatures in the area above the level of the caster or ones that have greater than 6 Hit Dice must make a Save vs. Spell. The spell's effects depend on the caster—creatures with Hit Dice/levels fewer than or equal to the caster are knocked unconscious (do not awaken when struck) for 5 rounds, those with Hit Dice/levels one or two greater than the wizard are blinded for 3 rounds, and any other creatures are stunned for 1 round.

Blind creatures are unaffected by the color spray.~
@12192 = ~Dimension Door

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transports the caster to any place within the visual range of the caster. When the spell is cast, a dimensional portal opens up in front of the caster, which <PRO_HESHE> immediately steps through.~
@12193 = ~Haste
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Haste doubles the base movement rate of all friendly creatures within the area of effect and grants them each an extra attack per round. (Spellcasting and spell effects are not sped up.) All affected by the Haste spell must be in the designated area of effect. Note that this spell negates the effects of a Slow spell. This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic. Anyone affected by Haste will suffer fatigue when the spell wears off.~
@12194 = ~Knock
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1

(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the wizard touches a creature while this spell is in effect, an electrical charge will deal 1d8 + 1/level points of damage to the creature. For example, a 5th-level wizard will deal 1d8+5 points of electrical damage. The wizard only has one charge, and once an opponent has been touched, the spell's energies have been used. The spell always hits unless the wizard is disrupted.~
@12196 = ~Slow
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Slow causes creatures to move and attack at 1/2 of their normal rates. It negates Haste, but does not otherwise affect magically sped-up or slowed creatures. Slowed creatures suffer -4 penalties to attack and Armor Class. To make matters worse, creatures save at -4 against this spell.~
@12197 = ~Strength
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Range: 20 ft.
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Upon application of this spell, the target's Strength is magically increased by an amount depending on its class. Warriors gain 1d8 points, priests and rogues gain 1d6 points, and wizards gain 1d4 points. For warriors only, all points above a Strength of 18 are converted into a 10% bonus for each extra point, to a maximum of 18/00. For other classes, 18 Strength is the maximum.~
@12198 = ~Vocalize
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell can cast spells with a verbal component without having to make any noise, so long as the casting takes place entirely within the duration of the Vocalize spell. This spell has no effect on other noises or speech—it simply removes a spell's verbal component. This spell is a great counter for Silence, 15' Radius.~
@12199 = ~Dispel Magic
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Protection
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Dispel Magic removes magical effects upon anyone within the area of effect, including deafness and feeblemindedness. This includes magically created items and the effects of spells and potions. It does not, however, affect magical items themselves.~
@12200 = ~Glyph of Warding
(Abjuration, Evocation)

Level: 3
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription, magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any creature violating the warded area sets off the glyph. The glyph deals 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the caster to the victim(s). A successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage. Leaving the area the glyph of warding is in will make it disappear harmlessly.~
@12201 = ~Protection From Evil

Level: 1
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, a magical barrier forms around the recipient and moves with <PRO_HIMHER>. The barrier has three effects: First, it bestows a +2 bonus to the recipient's Armor Class and Saving Throws against attacks from evil-aligned opponents; second, it prevents summoned fiends from attacking the recipient; third, it makes the recipient immune to charm-based spells or effects (e.g. Charm Person, Charm Person or Mammal, Domination, and so on).~
@12202 = ~Protection From Fire
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Protection, Elemental Fire
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn/level

This spell sets the target's Fire Resistance to 80%.~
@12203 = ~Remove Curse
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse from a person. Remove Curse does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, but will enable someone afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses cannot be countered by this spell.~
@12204 = ~Remove Fear
(Abjuration)

Level: 1
Sphere: Charm
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

The priest instills courage in the spell's recipients, raising their morale to its highest. The recipients' morale will gradually reset to normal as the spell's duration runs out. If the recipients are affected by magical fear, this is negated.~
@12205 = ~Remove Paralysis
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Protection
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

By the use of this spell, the priest can free allied creatures from the effects of any paralysis or related magic, such as a Ghoul Touch or Hold Person spell.~
@12206 = ~Sanctuary

Level: 1
Sphere: Protection
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all of <PRO_HISHER> opponents to ignore <PRO_HISHER> existence as if <PRO_HESHE> were invisible. While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but can use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal wounds, for example, or to bless <PRO_HIMHER>self. The priest cannot cast spells on other creatures without ending the spell.~
@12207 = ~Shillelagh
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Sphere: Combat, Plant
Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to create a magical club that grants a +1 bonus to attack rolls and inflicts 2d4 points of damage. The club's enchantment level is +1 for determining which creatures it can hit. Strength, proficiency, and specialization bonuses and penalties apply normally.~

Level: 1
Sphere: Plant
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

When this spell is cast, grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about any creatures within the area of effect, holding them fast for the duration of the spell. A successful Save vs. Spell avoids entanglement. Entangled creatures can still attack, even though they cannot move.~
@12209 = ~Barkskin

Level: 2
Sphere: Protection, Plant
Range: Touch
Duration: 4 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Barkskin causes a creature's skin to become as tough as bark, setting its base Armor Class to 6 and improving by 1 for every 4 levels of the caster: Armor Class 5 at 4th level, Armor Class 4 at 8th level, and so on up to a maximum of Armor Class of -1 at 30th level. In addition, the recipient's Saving Throws vs. Breath Weapon, Death, Polymorph, and Wand gain a bonus of +1.~
@12210 = ~Resist Fire/Cold
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5

Level: 2
Sphere: Guardian
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

Upon casting this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible and spells cannot be cast. Each creature in the area must make a Save vs. Spell; if the save is failed, they are silenced for the duration of the spell. Affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not.~
@12212 = ~Call Lightning
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Weather
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level, up to 11 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Visual range of the caster
Saving Throw: 1/2

A Call Lightning spell must be cast outside; otherwise, it will not work and the spell is wasted. The caster is able to call down 1 bolt per round per caster level (capped at 11 bolts). Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points per level of the caster. Thus, a 5th-level caster calls down five 7d8 bolts (2d8 + 5d8). The caster only chooses the first target of the spell, but subsequent bolts will only strike <PRO_HISHER> enemies.~
@12213 = ~Strength of One
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Law
Range: 0
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, party members within the area of effect are given a Strength score of 18/76. If a party member has a Strength higher than this (either naturally or through a magical item), then their Strength is lowered to 18/76. The spell lasts for 7 rounds, whereupon everyone's Strength returns to normal.~

Level: 4
Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons up to 6 animals of 4 or fewer Hit Dice. It can be cast indoors or outdoors, and the types of animals summoned depend on the caster's surroundings when the spell is cast.~
@12215 = ~Animal Summoning II
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 5
Sphere: Animal, Summoning
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster summons up to 6 animals that have 8 or fewer Hit Dice. Only normal or giant animals can be summoned; fantastic animals or monsters cannot be summoned by this spell (i.e. no dragons or elementals). This spell works indoors and outdoors.~
@12216 = ~Bless
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Sphere: All
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Upon uttering the Bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack and damage rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 40 ft.) the spell will be cast. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 15-ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effects; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~
@12217 = ~Chant

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

By means of the Chant spell, the priest brings special favor upon <PRO_HIMHER>self and <PRO_HISHER> party and causes harm to <PRO_HISHER> enemies. When the Chant spell is completed, all the priest's allies within the area of effect gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls, minimum damage rolls, and Saving Throws. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. For example, a 6d6 fireball will do 6d5 damage, and a flaming long sword that deals 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d3 fire damage will deal 1d8+2 slashing plus 1d2 fire damage instead. The priest's enemies suffer from the opposite effects.

Multiple chants are not cumulative. This spell requires a moderate amount of concentration by the caster, so the priest cannot cast any spells for the chant's duration, and <PRO_HISHER> movement is slowed by half.~
@12218 = ~Wall of Fire

The wall of fire spell brings forth an immobile, blazing curtain of magical fire of shimmering color—yellow-green or amber. The spell creates an opaque sheet of flame up to one 20-ft. square per level of the spellcaster, or a ring with a radius of up to 10 ft. + 5 ft. for every two levels of experience of the priest, and 20 ft. high.

'The wall of fire must be cast so that it is vertical with respect to the caster. The wall inflicts 4d4 points of damage, plus 1 point of damage per level of the spellcaster, to any creature passing through it. Creatures especially subject to fire may take additional damage, and undead always take twice normal damage. Note that attempting to directly catch moving creatures with a newly created wall of fire is difficult; a successful Saving Throw enables the creature to avoid the wall, while its rate and direction of movement determine which ~

Level: 2
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns

When a priest casts a Find Traps spell, all traps within the area of effect—concealed normally or magically, of magical or mechanical nature—become apparent to <PRO_HIMHER>, as if <PRO_HESHE> were a Thief.~
@12221 = ~Invisibility Purge

Level: 3
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 8

Sphere: Divination
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Know Alignment spell enables the priest to read the aura of a creature. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the effect. Evil creatures will glow red, neutrals blue, and good creatures will glow green for a brief period.~
@12223 = ~Charm Person or Mammal
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 2
Sphere: Animal
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell affects any single person or mammal it is cast upon. The term "person" includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, lizard men, orcs, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not.

A successful Save vs. Spell negates the effect. If the save is failed, the victim regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster can give them orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out without question.

If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed person by some overt action, or if Dispel Magic is successfully cast upon the charmed person, the Charm Person spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent one takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. No charmed creatures may leave the area or attack non-hostile targets.~

This spell holds 1d4 hostile animals rigidly immobile. Specifically, it affects the targeted enemy and up to 3 hostile creatures within 20 ft. of it. Only normal and giant-sized animals are affected by this spell. Strange monsters such as wyverns and carrion crawlers do not count as animals. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the effect.

Paralyzed creatures are helpless and cannot dodge or defend themselves from attacks. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the effect.

By using this spell, the priest can temporarily enchant a small pebble, which is then hurled or slung at an opponent. The stone deals 3d4 points of crushing damage to whomever it hits except undead creatures, who take 6d4 points of crushing damage instead. The stone is considered a magical weapon, although it does not have an attack or damage bonus.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from <PRO_HISHER> hand. This blade-like ray is wielded as if it were a scimitar (i.e. it uses the Scimitar proficiency). If the caster successfully hits with the flame blade in melee combat, the creature struck suffers 1d4 points of slashing damage plus 2 points of fire damage, with a further 2 fire damage if the creature is undead. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it.~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant

The priest calls upon <PRO_HISHER> god to grant <PRO_HIMHER> power for a short period. When <PRO_HESHE> does this, <PRO_HISHER> Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution all are raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster. A 3rd-level caster would have <PRO_HISHER> abilities raised by 1, while a 12th-level caster would have all <PRO_HISHER> abilities raised by 4.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

By calling upon <PRO_HISHER> deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a magical hammer which can be used as a weapon for the duration of the spell. The hammer strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 every 6 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of +3 at 13th level. The base crushing damage inflicted when the hammer scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer, 1d4+1. Unlike a normal war hammer, it can strike any target within its wielder's visual range.~

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is placed upon a poisoned individual, it slows the effects of venom. This spell does not neutralize the poison; instead, it just slows it down enough for the recipient to get real healing at a temple or from <PRO_HISHER> party's priest.

This spell also cures intoxication.~

Level: 5
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the priest casts a Raise Dead spell, <PRO_HESHE> can restore life to one of <PRO_HISHER> companions. Note that this spell does not work on elven characters. The person has but 1 Hit Point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic. Raise Dead will not work on someone killed by Death Spell, Finger of Death, Destruction, or Disintegrate. It cannot be cast by evil-aligned characters.~
@12327 = ~Goodberry
(Alteration, Evocation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Plant
Range: 0
Duration: 1 day/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 5 berries
Saving Throw: None

Casting a Goodberry spell creates a clump of magical berries that the caster can carry with <PRO_HIMHER>. These berries cure 5 points of damage when eaten. The berries will only last one day per level of the caster, so it's not advisable to carry them around for too long.~

The chilly weather doesn't even touch the town with the tree growing here; it radiates enough heat to keep things green, which is a sight for tired eyes here in the North. But hells, if you came through the Pass, you'll know that already.~

@13136 = ~History of Amn: 

Amn has the good fortune to have abundant natural resources; some would say Amn is the richest land on the continent. This has worked in Amn's favor for generations, because even if they were conquered, the new masters would be gentle, looking to gain wealth from the land, rather than to put it to the torch. 

Amn has been a center of trade and commerce for as long as anyone can remember. Oral traditions handed down from father to son tend to support the theory that Amn has been a trade center for at least 800 years. Unfortunately, written records are difficult to find and often incomplete. It would seem the typical Amnish citizen was too busy trying to fill their coffers to write down events of the day. 

Amn has always been more interested in the present and the future than the past, and this makes an accurate history difficult. The best records, the business papers of the oldest trading companies, are jealously guarded. The fear of revealing "trade secrets" is stronger than the call of history, so the average citizen knows very little about Amn's past. 

It appears that the Amn of 100 years ago was very much like the Calimshan of today. Each major city was basically an independent entity, banding together for defense when necessary, and fighting for control of territory and profitable trade routes the rest of the time. A particularly brutal trade war began 24 years ago, with each city exacting prohibitive tariffs on goods imported from the others. The trade war escalated, and city troops began to raid caravans sponsored by other cities. In a matter of months commerce was brought to a halt, a number of cities were under siege, and war threatened to engulf the entire region. 

Into the breach stepped a young merchant named Thayze Selemchant. Thayze was smart, charismatic, and very well connected (the Selemchant trading house was one of the oldest and richest in Athkatla.) He secretly contacted representatives of the five other richest merchant houses in Amn, and started to plan. 

The first part of the plan involved the careful sprinkling of rumors about outside threats. One involved a pirate invasion from the Nelanther, another was about a massing of orcs just on the other side of the Cloud Peaks. Thayze even started a rumor about an elf army in the Forest of Tethir, ready to pounce on a divided Amn. None of the rumors were true, but they began to turn people's thoughts toward unity, not war. 

Thayze knew that if he and the other members of his council were to take control of Amn, they would need broad-based popular support. Tensions between cities and merchant houses were still high, so to get that support, Selemchant and the others agreed to drop their family names and never use them again. 

When news of a "Council of Six" spread throughout the land, many people accepted their rule. A group that would unite Amn under one rule, governing for the benefit of all instead of one city or trading company over another, was indeed a welcome change. The Council raised an army (at great personal expense) to quell the few pockets of resistance that remained, and have been in total control of Amn for the past 22 years.

@13137 = ~History of Calimshan:

Calimshan is older than either of the other Empires of the Sands, first settled over 7,000 years ago by the Djen, a humanoid race from the Elemental Plane of Air. These Djen were known to be very magical, and during the course of their rule they developed many new spells previously not available in the Plane of Air.

The Djen prospered for over 1,000 years in Calimshan, but their reign was ended by an invasion of creatures and minions from the Plane of Fire. Some say this is where the bitter hatred between djinni and efreeti started, though others contend this was just a result of a hatred that was already there. Whatever the cause, the battle was long and bloody, and took over 100 years to complete. The Djen finally routed the attackers, but were greatly weakened in the attempt. They slowly declined, and the last mention of the Djen is just under 6,000 years old.

For the next 4,000 years Calimshan was dominated by nomadic tribes of humans. Tribes from various places—Chult, the Shaar, The Shining Plains, Chondath, even Amn and Cormyr—took turns dominating, only to be conquered by the next, nearly identical tribe.

Slowly, the nomadic nature of Calimshan began to change. As explorers and traders from Amn, Waterdeep, and Cormyr discovered the wonders of the area, some tribes began to settle down and develop new means of support, like fishing, farming, or trading. These communities began to band together for mutual protection, and soon a civilization was born. It was only 1,300 years ago that the Shoon Empire (now called Iltkazar) came into being.

The Shoons were a grand and glorious empire, and their excesses were the foundation of Calishite snobbery today. They grew wise and powerful in the ways of magic, and ships and caravans bearing the Shoon flag traveled across the realms. Shoon himself, a particularly powerful mage, created a book of great power during this time called the Tome of the Unicorn. The exact location of the Tome has been lost in time, but since the book is 2' by 3' and made of pure metal, it is likely to still be around... somewhere.

900 years ago the Shoon empire abruptly vanished. A great magical upheaval was suspected at first, but learned mages of other lands dispute the claim. A force that great, they say, would have disturbed magical powers and beings throughout the realms, and that didn't happen. Sages who have studied the Shoon at great length have reached no definite conclusions, but the most popular theories today center around a plague or disease that decimated the population.

Today, the Shoon impact on Calimshan is still great. The grandeur of that empire is responsible, more than anything else, for the strong national character of Calimshan today. The ruins of the Shoon's greatest city, Monrativi Teshy Mir, can still be found in the wilderness to the west of the edge of the Forest of Mir (see below for more on Monrativi Teshy Mir).

Since the fall of Shoon, no force or people has risen to solely dominate the land. There are a half dozen or so major cities, each of which exerts its power over its own area. About 170 years ago, a man in Calimport amassed a large army and declared himself "Pasha" over the land. Before that army could march, however, the representatives of each major city met and agreed to recognize the Pasha's authority in limited areas, and to pay a small tribute to him; enough to pay for the works the Pasha was expected to do. The oldest son of each Pasha inherits the title; if there is no son, the mayors of each large city select a new one. The current Pasha, Rashid Djenispool, has ruled for over 18 years, and is the grandson of a pasha elected by the mayors of Calimshan 44 years ago.~
@13138 = ~History of Cormyr: 

Cormyr dates its years from the founding of House Obarskyr 1,342 years ago, the first of the noble houses and the line of its kings. For the bulk of this time, Cormyr was little more than a single city (Suzail) and a few fortified outposts. At times the monarch was forced by rebellion and intrigue to rule from those outposts instead of from the throne. King Azoun is the fourth of his name and the 71st of his line. 

The land has been officially at peace for many years—since Rhigaerd overthrew the last of the border raiders. However, Cormyrean armies have taken part in many actions in nearby regions, recently mustering its forces to face Gondegal, the rebel of Arabel; to occupy Tilverton on the marches of the Dalelands; and to lead a crusade against the great Tuigan horde invading from the east. One wit has noted that "Yes, the land is at peace, but the army has to keep busy." In addition to pursuing major actions, Cormyrean patrols often skirmish with bandits on the roads in the north and west, and are at present battling orcs and other creatures north and east of Cormyr in Tilver's Gap and Shadow Gap. Both of these areas are threatened by raiders who will menace Cormyr itself if they ever overrun Tilverton. Cormyr has built a fortress, Castle Crag, to defend the kingdom from attacks from that quarter, and maintains the High Horn to protect against attacks from the West.~
@13139 = ~History of Dambrath:

The nation of Dambrath was formed out of a barbarian kingdom almost a half-millennium ago by a powerful alliance of priestesses of Loviatar and the drow from the city of T'lindhet.

In 211 DR, fleeing from the destruction of the homeland by the then-great kingdoms of Unther and Mulhorand, four tribes of barbarians entered Dambrath. They found a coast where the dolphins danced and plains where the grass was long. They roamed from the borders of the Walls of Halruaa as far east as the current borders of Estagund. They soon became known as the Arkaiun, or people of the wind.

In 545 DR a great warchief, Reinhar, arose to lead the tribes. The halflings of Luiren were quickly enslaved, and several of the coastal cities of Durpar were captured or razed. Estagund fell to his rule, and  eventually Reinhar turned his attention to Halruaa.

An army of 40,000 horsemen and a fleet of 50 ships mounted a coordinated attack, and even though Reinhar was able to get beyond the Walls of Halruaa and occupy the cities of Mithel, Galdel, and Zalsuu, their magics proved to be more than a match for the invaders. Reinhar was finally defeated in a great battle at Sulaziir by the archmage Mycontil and his troop of wizards.

Reinhar's son, Reinhar II, took command of the army and set out on a two month overland retreat. He arrived home with a thousand surviving fighting men and no shaman. Reinhar II proved to be as good a ruler in defeat as his father was in war. He consolidated his forces and pulled home almost all of his troops, as he knew that the defeat made them tempting prey for raiders and encroaching monsters. This action allowed for the safe development of his peoples.

By the time the ninth Reinhar was king in 802 DR, the Arkaiuns were fat and lazy. Reinhar IX, or Reinhar the Foolish as he is more commonly known, insisted on expanding his nation to gain more gold to finance his military campaigns. He ordered the mining of many rich lodes of silver and electrum in the Gnollwatch mountains, but before his plans of expansion could begin, the miners encountered the drow of T'lindher. The drow were outraged and began a steady series of raids and attacks on the Arkaiun strongholds. Whole villages were destroyed overnight, and no trace of the invaders could be found.

Reinhar IX committed the foolhardy action of attacking the drow in retaliation. While the Arkaiuns managed to get a force into the drow city, this action only succeeded in uniting the normally chaotic drow. For once, the full power of a drow city was turned against an enemy.

The battle quickly moved back to the surface. Reinhar's raiders were wiped out, leaving Reinhar with only a small portion of his original military. This was not enough for the drow, who demanded total enslavement of the entire surface nation. The Arkaiuns resisted valiantly, and the war went on for three decades at tremendous cost in life to both sides.

Finally, the drow had the Arkaiun forces cornered at Malduir. Almost without hope, the defenders were overjoyed when a group of half-elven pilgrims appeared on the scene. The high priestess, Cathtyr Shintar, offered the aid of her clerics to help defend the city, and Reinhar took this to be an omen from the gods. A priestess was placed with almost every company.

Within a tenday the drow struck. The priestesses did indeed prove to be of great aid, but to the drow. Every priestess turned on the Arkaiuns, and Cathtyr herself slew Reinhar. The drow were still weakened by the battle, and only the presence of the priestesses enabled them to win. Cathtyr, realizing the unique advantage she possessed, made a deal that even the suspicious drow embraced. Her priestesses would rule the land, and in exchange they would provide access to the surface for the drow, trading weapons, slaves, and supplies.

The drow were delighted with this brazen offer from a surface dweller. Reinhar had been slain and the insult avenged, and after 30 years of war the drow were not particularly interested in Dambrath. They did insist, however, on taking the best captured males as slaves. Cathtyr quickly agreed to this, seeing the males as an obstacle to her own power.

Cathtyr ruled for 205 years. She fulfilled her promise to make Dambrath, or "The Nation of Pain," a bastion of evil in the realms. In her time, Cathtyr saw the priesthood of Loviatar expand to thousands, and faith in the Beastlords previously worshiped by the Arkaiuns was nearly eradicated. Many of the Arkaiuns were able to escape their new mistresses and flee to the Swagdar. There they resumed their almost forgotten nomadic life.

The priestesses of Loviatar continued to enjoy good relations with the drow, and some even took mates, creating a race of drow half-elves. These dark half-elves became known as the Crintri, or "noble ones." Most are priestesses of Loviatar, though many are mages as well. They consolidated their power, learning much of the area from the Shebali, or "lower ones," as the Arkaiuns are now called. The capital of Dambrath was established at Cathtyr, built after Cathtyr's passing and named in her honor. Her death came at the hands of her daughter, Filina, who had grown tired of waiting for her mother to die. Filina ruled for only five years, however, before her own daughter, Cathakay, assumed the throne in the same fashion. Cathakay ruled for 54 years, eventually falling in battle against a gold dragon. She died childless, and her niece Melanith assumed the throne.

Melanith faced an increasing population, and unrest among males who longed for a return to their prestige of old. Melanith did not return their previous status, but she did make use of them. Fearing that the great nations of Mulhorand and Unther might rise again, she decided that mundane tasks, such as the defense of the kingdom, would be handled by men. She was the first to name a male to the post of warchief. Sadalar, a Crintri, became the queen's consort. His term as warchief was characterized by widespread bribery and corruption. He was, however, responsible for getting many privileges returned to the Arkaiuns. After Melanith's rule, the Shebali were considered second class citizens, rather than slaves.

Though males were granted more power during her rule, Melanith also solidified the split between the sexes. While the rulers of Dambarth had been females for over two centuries, it was more because of competence than gender. Melanith, however, decreed that men could have no authority except over other men. The female-led hierarchy of Loviatar was quick to back this move.

Many of the bravest and best men of the kingdom perished in raids on Estagund, Durpar, the bandit tribes of Veldorn, and against the gnolls that had returned to the Gnollwatch Mountains. Some even fought at the side of the drow in their battle with the svirfneblin city of Aventine. The deep gnomes were destroyed, but so were the Shebali. The drow and the Crintri were largely unharmed, and for their aid, the Crintri were rewarded with a number of drow males to breed in to their race. Melanith took a drow male as her consort to replace Sadalar, who had perished in the conflict. The drow, Nym Inthigg, fathered three daughters and a son. It was at this time that Melantih began the isolationist policy that Dambrath still follows today.

Melanith ruled for 156 years; her daughter Ausitil for 125. The current queen of Dambrath is Yenandra; she is known there as the "Pirate Queen," for she has sailed as far south as Zakhara on pillaging raids. Yenandra has been ruling for 71 years, and is beginning to show signs of age. She has three daughters as well, named Luatharyn, Meltruil, and Hasafir. While she does remain extremely popular, especially to the Crintri, the children of leaders in this land are not known to patiently wait their turn.~
@13140 = ~History of Durpar and Var the Golden:

Durpar and Var the Golden share a common history. Over three-thousand years ago, these countries were both subject to the great kingdom of Raurin. When Raurin fell in -2488 DR, the countries of Durpar and Var barely survived the destruction.

Rioting, mass destruction, and hatred of nobility were rampant, and the two countries descended into barbarism for over two millennia. Finally, after most of the barbarian tribes were wiped out by the great empire of Mulhorand, a leader emerged. Satama, a mere trader, experienced a divine revelation and formulated a new philosophy  All things in the world were connected, were part of a single creation spirit, and all of the gods of the realms were merely parts of the same entity. Soon all the Shining Lands embraced the teachings of Satama, and the seeds of civilization were laid in what came to be known as the Lands of the One.

Since the Lands of the One had many natural resources, trade with Mulhorand and Luiren became a way of life. Merchants were honored above all. In time, the Maharajah of Durpar and the Rajah of Var were replaced with a Council of Merchants. During this time the land suffered occasional raiding attacks from the horsewomen of Dambrath, and had many skirmishes with the neighboring countries of Estagund and Ulgarth.

In 1023 DR, after an armed peace had been worked out with Ulgarth, the Council of Merchants decided that something needed to done about the raiders from Estagund who were hurting trade with other countries. War was an inconvenience, but interrupting trade was life-threatening.

Jeradeem, the richest merchant in the lands, was given power to negotiate a settlement. During these negotiations he proved, at least in the eyes of the Durparians, that he was indeed the master trader he seemed. Estagund had just tried a foolish invasion of Dambrath. The vengeful female leaders of that land wiped out nearly every able-bodied fighting man they sent. The monsters of Veldorn were causing problems, and Estagund was going through a famine.

It was here that Jeradeem showed his fine merchant's instincts. He could not pass up such an advantage, and began bargaining the most outrageous trade of all time. He met with the leaders of Estagund, a fearful king and his nobles, and explained the advantages of Durparian life and the philosophy of the Adama, the oneness of all things. He bargained for days until finally the king made the trade. He purchased the whole of Estagund for the countries of Durpar and Var at the price of 24 gems. He also promised protection, and help for their integration into the Durparian way of life. Thus were formed the Shining Lands.

Within a hundred years, the three countries shared a common way of life, and with the added strength and resources of Estagund, Durparian merchants increased their trading range. They roamed as far east as Kara-Tur, as far north as the Sea of Fallen Stars, and west to Dambrath and Halruaa. At the present time, with the newly discovered lands of Maztica and Zakhara beckoning, the future looks bright.~
@13141 = ~History of Estagund:

Estagund history follows a different path than those of Durpar and Var. The Gunders were conquered in 551 DR by Reinhar I, warchief of the Arkaiuns of Dambrath. Estagund regained its independence when Reinhar was slain by the Halruaan archmage Mycontil, though the country soon degenerated into a group of small independent city states.

Skirmishes with Var, and between the city-states, continued for several centuries until a king once again united the country. King Bornial was a skilled ruler, and under him Estagund began to prosper. His descendants did not share his wisdom, and in 1053 DR, King Selkarin more than illustrated this. He had failed to conquer Durpar, and Veldorn resisted his challenges. An avowed misogynist, Selkarin turned his attentions to the matriarchy of Dambrath. He led a large fleet to attack Dambrath, taking extreme losses, including his own life. Selkarin died childless, so his brother Seltarir was crowned King. The new ruler faced a country with most of its fighting men gone, and an unforeseen problem: famine. The famine was caused by a blight that wiped out nearly all the year's crops in Estagund. This made him eager for a deal posed by the Durparian merchant Jeradeem, and in a legendary trade the entire country of Estagund was sold. Contrary to popular rumor, Seltarir did not trade away the country for 24 pearls. In actuality he received diamonds worth almost a million gold pieces. The sudden wealth gave him an instant seat on the Council of Merchants, so he retained a measure of rule in addition to his fortune. Chaka Seltarir is still the richest chaka in Estagund to this day. In the years that followed, the Gunders began rebuilding their lives under their new circumstance, and now they compete on equal footing with the merchants of Durpar and Var.~
@13142 = ~History of Gondegal the Lost King: 

Arabel, long under the dominion of Cormyr, for a time became the center of a swordsman's empire. This swordsman was Gondegal, the Lost King, who in the Year of the Dragon (1352 DR) attempted to carve a kingdom for himself centered on Arabel. It was to extend north to the Desertsmouth Mountains; south and west of Wyvernwater and the farms outlying from Eveningstar; and east to Tilver's Gap and the mountain passes. 

In the years following, people would say that Gondegal's reach was no longer than his blade. He could not hold any of the territory against the might of Cormyr, Sembia, Daggerdale, Tilverton, and several of the other Dales -all of whom he drew the blood and ire of in the making of his throne. 

Gondegal ruled for less than a season, though he reigned officially for scarcely eight days. The remainder of his rule was spent fighting here and there against one foe or another in the lands he claimed. His troops were largely mercenary, and his treasury of seized goods was small and soon gone. One night Gondegal's force simply melted away before the advancing troops of Cormyr, and was gone. King Azoun IV retook Arabel on that morn without wetting a blade. 

No one has ever found the body of Gondegal; he is known to have fled north and then east via Teshwave, but then his fate becomes a matter of conflicting rumor and legend. Some believe he still lives with a score or more of loyal followers, keeping court in the wilds somewhere, a careful and ruthless bandit who takes care that none survive his attacks to carry tales anywhere. When entire caravans vanish at times anywhere between the High Dale and far-off Impiltur, he is blamed by talk in the taverns. 

Gondegal was said to be a tall, gray-haired warrior of considerable personal skill and intelligence. His badge was a gray wolf's head, face on, with red eyes. Caravan guards often warn merchants to beef up the escort on a particular caravan, "else thy gold'll soon be gilding Gondegal's throne." Gondegal was an impeccable swordsman and somewhat chaotic in his self professed neutral alignment. If he does indeed yet live, the magic or treasure he carries, and who his allies might be, are all unknown.

Gondegal's reign had a great influence on the King of Cormyr, at that time in his second decade of rule. Not only was Azoun forced to put down an effective rebellion in his own country, he was forced to pay more attention to matters outside Suzail, to become the ruler of a nation as opposed to a city-state. Further, the bloodless assault on Arabel was Azoun's first true experience at the head of his army, and the joy of "freeing" the people of Arabel is one that remains with him.

@13143 = ~History of Halruaa:

Halruaa was settled centuries ago by wizards fleeing the Phaerimm in what was to become the Anauroch desert. The first wizards came in unique flying ships invented by the Netherese, and found a beautiful and rich country settled only by shepherds and large herds of aurochs and wild rothe. It was here that the wizards decided to make a stand, should the Phaerimm follow. The Phaerimm never did, but Halruaa has had to defend itself from attacks by all of its neighbors since then.

Over the centuries, Dambrath has attacked and raided Halruaa's ports and borders multiple times. Once, led by a magic-resistant barbarian, the Dambraii occupied all of the country south of Lake Halruaa. They were defeated in battle by the great archmage Mycontil, who slew their barbarian leader. Forty thousand Dambraii attacked, and were stopped by five hundred Halruaans. More than two hundred Halruaan wizards, including Mycontil, died in the battle.

The last attack upon Halruaa was less than one hundred years ago, through the Telath Pass by the power-hungry king of Lapaliiya. He had allied with bandits from the wastes, though this time the Halruaans were able to field a larger force, including fighting men as well as wizards in their skyships. The attackers were easily routed.

Halruaa also suffered through a civil war about five centuries ago, when a number of mages advocated beginning new experiments in magic, ones which even the Netherese didn't approve of. The renegades were driven from the region, but went on to found the land of Thay, or so it is said in Halruaa.

Since then, Halruaa has been at peace (they have had no declared wars), though it still suffers raids from Dambraii pirates, bandits of the wastes, savages from the Mhair Jungles, and any other pirate, raider, or hungry wizard who thinks that magic and wealth grow on trees in Halruaa.

This constant raiding has made the Halruaans very defensive, warlike, and traditional. The people say that since wizards have always led them, wizards always will.~
@13144 = ~History of Luiren, Land of the Halflings: 

The halflings of Luiren claim that it is the original homeland of halflings in the realms. Although other halflings may disagree with this, it is true that Luiren was settled hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago. 

Luiren's history is one of conquerors and subjugation. Throughout the centuries, the halflings have been conquered by the barbarians who used to inhabit Dambrath, by the kingdom of Estagund, and even once by the monsters of Beldorn. In every case, the invaders were eventually defeated because they made the mistake of underestimating the halflings due to their small stature. A good bit of mischief, mayhem, and general trouble-making by the halflings also helped end the occupations.

Currently, Luiren is enjoying unprecedented prosperity. The halflings are currently taking advantage of their relationship with the nation of Durpar; their biggest customer and greatest competitor. Also, through these close ties with Durpar, Luiren has protected itself against another Dambraii invasion. The rulers of Dambrath must know that if they begin to expand to the east, they will arouse the ire of Durpar, as well as Var and Estagund. The threat of a trade embargo and/or military consequences have kept this aggressive nation away from the Luireners.~
@13145 = ~History of Sembia:

The land of Sembia was settled by humans coming to the Sea of Fallen Stars from the south, and was originally chosen for its stands of huge, high-quality iliyr-wood timber so prized in shipbuilding. However, as the forests were cleared over the years, the treecutters came into increasing conflict with elves who feared the loss of their entire wood. This would undoubtedly have occurred, had not the hastily gathered mercenary troops of the fledgling land been defeated by the elves at Singing Arrows (884 DR). This battle convinced distant Chondath to abandon its holdings in the region and allow the immigrant Sembians to establish their independence (though as little more than a collection of rival city-states, much like the Moonsea or Vast of today). It also set the stage for the appearance of the Raven.

The young country grew strong as farms prospered in the newly cleared lands. Craftsmen arrived from the south to take advantage of this chance to acquire land and wealth, bringing their trades with them. Rauthauvyr the Raven unified the city-states and towns in the face of the continuing "elven menace," and insisted on maintaining a standing army, which he kept in practice by policing Sembia's borders and improving its roads. At this time (913 DR), Sembia became as a true nation.

The Moonsea's (Dragon Sea's) mineral wealth was discovered by humankind at about this time, and pressure began to grow for a trade road through the elven woods to make Sembia the world's gateway to all these riches. The Raven went alone as an envoy to the Elven Court. There, he asked the elders of their Council to approve a road, open to humans, linking Sembia to the shores of the Dragon Sea (an earlier road had been destroyed during the conflict and was now overgrown). Raven proposed that the elves choose the route and retain control of it and the woods around it, so that no woodcutting or human settlement would occur. The elves had earlier made similar arrangements with the Dalesmen and had no difficulty with the concept of such an agreement. However, the inhabitants of Velarsdale (now Harrowdale) refused the proposal, not wanting or needing such a road at that time (curious, since later a ruler of Harrowdale commissioned the disastrous Halfaxe Trail). The elves, not wishing to offend long-time allies, refused Raven's request.

Rebuffed, the Raven then threatened to exterminate the isolated elves in Amothoi, the last embattled remnant of the elves in Sembia, if the Elven Court did not cooperate. If the road was built, however, they would be free to trade, or not trade, as they wished. The elves agreed under this pressure, and Sembia's financial future was secured. Hillsfar, on the shores of the Dragon Sea, became a commercial meeting ground between humankind and elves, as did Elventree. The route the elves chose ran past the base of the Standing Stone as a reminder of earlier, less-hostile dealings between humans and elves. Over the years the elves of Amothoi came north to join their brethren or slipped away to seek Evermeet, leaving their wood to gradually disappear.

Sembia grew rich under merchant leaders of increasing wisdom, such as Saer (for whom Saerb was named) and Selgar (for whom Chancelgaunt was renamed as Selgaunt). Before his death, Rauthauvyr the Raven saw that these merchants had a strong standing council of merchant elders to advise them and to ensure that no ruler could hold onto power by force of arms. Then this farsighted man, creator of a nation, now half-blind and infirm from old war wounds, rode north into the elven woods and disappeared. None know what happened to him or where his bones lie, save perhaps some few elder elves.~
@13146 = ~History of Shadowdale—The Fall of Azmaer, Last Drow Marshal of the Twisted Tower:

The drow rule of Shadowdale lasted until the early 900s Dale Reckoning, when the increased human population in the area brought the dark elves into conflict with their now more numerous neighbors. The humans were the Dalesmen who a millennium earlier had crossed the Dragon Reach and made peace with the elves of Myth Drannor, settling at the borders of the great woods that was the elven home. The drow soon found themselves under continual attack, and most of those who held overground settlements retreated back below. The last powerful drow leader was Azmaer, the marshal of the Twisted Tower in its last drow-held days. Azmaer oversaw the last retreat of the drow holdings in the face of a human uprising, and held the citadel against a year-long siege. With supplies and slaves brought up from the Underdark directly into the tower, the drow could have conceivably held out forever; however, a human slave (family histories in the Dales indicate a number of possible individuals) poisoned the well in the Tower and the citadel was easily overrun. Azmaer's body was not found among the dead, leading some to believe that he escaped back into the depths to rejoin his people. Noting the fact that he would have had to explain to his matriarch how he lost Shadowdale, it is much more likely that, should Azmaer have survived, he went into voluntary exile, hiding from both human and drow. Given that this occurred only 400 years ago, it is certainly possible that Azmaer still lives.~
@13147 = ~History of Shadowdale—Ashaba Becomes First Lord of Shadowdale:

Upon taking the Twisted Tower and removing the drowish yoke from the people, the Dalesmen had fully established the Dale of Shadowdale, with its seat of power in the tower itself. Its first lord was a water wizard who had aided in the final attack;  Ashaba, who was great in age when he ascended, and ruled peacefully for 40 years thereafter. It is said that Ashaba realized he was dying and turned himself to water, merging with the river. Since that time, the river, the ford, and the Twisted Tower all bear his name. Before passing on, Ashaba chose one of his trusted lieutenants as the new lord of Shadowdale. Presented to the people of the Dale, he was made the new lord by acclamation. In an additional honor, the pendant worn by Ashaba was thereafter recognized as a symbol of the lordship in the Dalelands, and was possessed by each of the successive lords following.~
@13148 = ~History of Shadowdale— Joadath and the Tyrist Massacre: 

The past hundred years have been an example of the best and worst of the lords of Shadowdale. All have been nonnative to the Dalelands, though all made the land their home. A century ago the lord of the Dales was one Joadath, a stiff-necked agnostic who denied the power of any god, good or evil, and used force to back up his beliefs. During this time there was a great deal of religious persecution, including a massacre of Tyrists on Watcher's Knoll. Joadath was eventually killed by a beast of the nether planes summoned by parties unknown, which then proceeded to rampage through the Dale. The beast was killed and Shadowdale rescued by the spellcasters Aumry and Sylune. Aumry was proclaimed lord by acclamation.~
@13149 = ~History of Shadowdale—Aumry Rules in Peace:

The longest period of peaceful rule was by Lord Aumry and his wife Sylune (better known as the Witch of Shadowdale). They ruled over the community for forty years, a period of extended peace with their neighboring dales, nations, and the elven peoples. It was this very peace and power which made the Dale the target for attacks and sabotage by the Black Network (Zhentarim). They sought (and still seek) to control the trade from the Moonsea to the Sword Coast, and desired to make Shadowdale a vassal state of Zhentil Keep. Lord Aumry's rule ended tragically when he was assassinated by Zhentish agents.~
@13150 = ~History of Shadowdale— Jyordhan the False Lord: 

 Lord Aumry was assassinated by Zhentarim agents, who in turn were captured and killed by the warrior Jyordhan. Jyordhan, with the Pendant of Ashaba in hand (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), proceeded to present himself as the new lord, and was so acclaimed by the people. It was unknown to the people that Jyordhan was also an agent of the Zhentarim, and that the entire proceeding had actually been a ruse. 

Jyordhan abandoned the Twisted Tower, instead establishing himself in Castle Krag east of Shadowdale. His court was soon overrun with agents of the Black Network. When the people eventually revolted, Zhentil Keep sent peace-keeping forces to maintain Jyordhan's rule. Sylune, Lord Aumry's widow, now aware of the deception but a firm pacifist, did her best to keep the Dale healthy and intact during Jyordhan's evil rule.~
@13151 = ~History of Shadowdale— Khelben Kills Jyordhan: 

Lord Jyordhan's rule of Shadowdale ended when he encountered Khelben Arunsun, also called the Blackstaff. The story at the time was that Jyordhan accepted an invitation from Khelben to visit Waterdeep, and there he took ill and died. In reality, Jyordhan ambushed Khelben as the mage was leaving Shadowdale, and the Blackstaff killed him. In either case, Khelben took hold of the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales) and returned to Waterdeep with it, promising to send a suitable candidate for lordship to the Dales. Jyordhan had ruled for five years, and without his advocacy, Castle Krag was abandoned and the Zhentil Keep troops routed. Jyordhan's previously chosen successor was a Melvauntan named Lyran, but without the Pendant this individual was considered a pretender to the throne.~
@13152 = ~History of Shadowdale—Lords Accepted by Acclamation: 

This acclamation of the people has formed the basis for choosing the lord of Shadowdale since the routing of the evil Lord Jyordhan by Khelben Blackstaff. Usually a predecessor will step down as opposed to dying in office, and his chosen successor will be approved by the populace at large. This system has had its drawbacks, as will be shown below, but in general, it has served the independent, self-willed people of the Dale very well. They have avoided the "genetic lottery of which good bureaucracies and bad kingships are made" (a quote from the venerable Elminster). The symbol of the lordship is the Pendant of Ashaba, a device owned by the original wizard, and used to determine the rightful lord of the Dale.~
@13153 = ~History of Shadowdale—The Time of No Lords: 

 During the period when Khelben Blackstaff held the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the lordship in the Dales), Sylune (widow of the murdered Lord Aumry) was the de facto ruler of Shadowdale, though these years were known as the Time of No Lords. Sylune and an adventuring company known as Mane's Band were responsible for driving out the Zhentil Keep forces and keeping at bay the monsters in the area. The Twisted Tower, the traditional seat of leadership, remained uninhabited following its abandonment by the evil Lord Jyordhan, and neither Sylune nor the companions of Mane's Band wished to assume the mantle of leader. With time, Mane's Band passed on to other lands and adventures.~
@13154 = ~History of Shadowdale—Doust Sulwood Becomes Lord of Shadowdale:

Three winters following his defeat of the evil Lord Jyordhan, Khelben  Blackstaff found a suitable candidate to assume leadership of the Dales, or rather a group of candidates. They were the Knights of Myth Drannor, so named to show their interest in the elven territories and their connection with the elven peoples, and Khelben gave them the Pendant of Ashaba (the symbol of the Lordship) in return for services rendered to himself and to Shadowdale. Their leader, the ranger Florin Falconhand, refused the honor of the lordship. It was therefore passed to Doust Sulwood, who was made the new lord with the support of Florin and Sylune (wife of the murdered Lord Aumry), and apparently also the secret support of Khelben as well.

Doust reoccupied the Twisted Tower, driving out the last agents of the Black Network. He also re-instituted many of Ashaba's democratic ideals, including the Lord's Court where all citizens may speak freely and air their grievances without threat of reprisal. Doust ruled for five years and proved to be a capable ruler, beloved by the people. The regular presence of the Knights of Myth Drannor did much to ensure the protection of the area, particularly against incursions by Lyran Nanther the Pretender. Lyran was to have been Jyordhan's named replacement, but with the Zhentarim routed there was little validity to the claim.~
@13155 = ~History of Shadowdale—Elminster Moves to Shadowdale: 

It is of note that during the time that Doust Sulwood of the Knights of Myth Drannor assumed the role of Lord of Shadowdale, Elminster took up residence in the area. A semi-regular visitor up to that time, he took possession of a low, abandoned tower at the foot of the Old Skull, and declared himself to be officially in retirement. The nature of that retirement varies from active involvement in local affairs to long-term vacations on other planes. The natives of the Dale have come to the understanding that they cannot always count on the powerful mage being in residence in times of need or danger, but when he is present in these circumstances his aid is usually given.~
@13156 = ~History of Shadowdale—Doust Chooses Mourngrym Amcathra to Succeed Him: 

Doust Sulwood, recommended to the position by Khelben Blackstaff, ruled Shadowdale as lord for five years. "Seems like a millennium," he was oft known to have reported, and the tedium of court life and the lure of adventure eventually caused him to retire his position and rejoin the Knights of Myth Drannor in regular adventuring. He handed the Pendant of Ashaba (symbol of the Lordship) on to one of the younger Knights, a Waterdhavian noble named Mourngrym Amcathra. Mourngrym had been dispatched by Khelben from Waterdeep for other purposes, but Doust liked both the young man's straightforward honesty and his willingness to shoulder the burden of protecting the small community from myriad dangers. Time has proven this choice a wise one.~
@13157 = ~History of Shadowdale—Shaerl and Mourngrym Meet and Marry: 

The implications of Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun "choosing" the last two lords of Shadowdale (Doust Sulwood and Mourngrym Amcathra) were not lost on the Dale's powerful neighbor to the south, Cormyr. An agent was sent northward to divine Mourngrym's true intentions and to guarantee the Dale's continued good relationship with the throne of the Purple Dragon. The agent was a rogue named Shaerl Rowanmantle, sent by Vangerdahast (though all paperwork on this matter has been curiously incinerated in Suzail, so all is hearsay and tale). Shaerl discovered more than she intended and fell in love with young Mourngrym. The two married and became the lord and lady of Shadowdale. Shaerl's loyalty is now to her husband and to the land they co-rule. This was probably not the intention of the Cormyreans.~
@13158 = ~History of Shadowdale— Mourngrym's Rule:

Since being recommended to the position by outgoing Lord Doust Sulwood, Lord Mourngrym Amcathra's rule of Shadowdale has been less peaceful than he had hoped. The First Battle of Shadowdale occurred in the Year of the Prince (1357 DR), and involved Daleland forces routing those of Lyran the Pretender. Lyran has made repeated attempts to gain the Lordship, as was intended by the former Zhentish puppet, Lord Jyordhan. While significant, this battle pales when compared to the larger battle fought on the same site between Bane-led Zhentil Keep forces and the Dales during the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR). When the Battle of Shadowdale is referred to (without a number), it usually means this second battle. In addition, Mourngrym has had to deal with a large number of skirmishes, incursions, a possible invasion from below, explosions, and other sundry disasters. 

Mourngrym and Shaerl have one child, Scotti, who is now nine winters old. By the customs of the area, he is not considered the heir apparent, and another suitable warrior or mage may take the reins of power of the small community. Most feel that Mourngrym will hold the Pendant until his son has reached his maturity, then abdicate in young Scotti's favor once he takes his grown name. If this happens, it will be the first occasion of the lordship of Shadowdale passing down through a family.~
@13159 = ~History of Tethyr:

For the past 1500 years, Tethyr has had a single, strong royal family ruling with absolute power. When a king died or became incapacitated, his oldest son took the throne. As the family trees of those close to power became more intertwined and complicated, there were the inevitable wars of succession and bickering over which second cousin was the "true" heir to the throne. Civil wars were brief, however, and once the fighting was over the system returned to normal (until the next major dispute in a few hundred years or so).

The established re-occurring cycle was broken 10 years ago. The current ruling family had been in power for over 350 years, so long that they had dropped their own family name centuries ago (no one even remembers it now) and simply called themselves Tethyr. King Alemander IV was comfortably ruling from Castle Tethyr, and the country seemed happy enough, but there was a broad current of dissatisfaction among the people of Tethyr. Non-humans were forbidden by law to own land, and since most rights and privileges accorded citizens were based on land ownership, they became second-class citizens as well. Things were especially bad for elves, who were driven deep into the Forest of Tethir by royal armies. Alemander IV took land away from rightful owners and gave it to nobles who promised larger contributions to the royal treasury. These social and economic inequities, coupled with several harsh winters and bad harvests in a row, made the time ripe for a change.

It takes more than just a couple of lousy winters to depose a king however, it takes treachery as well. In the case of the fall of House Tethyr it took an ambitious general and an impatient royal heir. Prince Alemander grew tired of waiting for the robust Alemander IV to make room for him, so he struck a deal with General Nashram Sharboneth, commander of the king's largest army. While Sharboneth marched his army toward Tethyr, bringing along a sizable group of angry peasants recruited with the promise of land reform, the would-be Alemander V downplayed alarming reports from the king's spies and advisors, silencing the most persistent permanently through murder or exile. By the time Sharboneth's army arrived and laid siege to Castle Tethyr, it was too late for loyalists to help.

As Sharboneth launched a direct assault on the castle (using the expendable peasants as shock troops), a handful of elite soldiers let in a secret entrance by the prince would eliminate key guards and open the gates. At the same time, the prince (one of the few people allowed to see the king directly) would murder his father. A fire set by the elite troops would destroy evidence of treachery; the general and the prince would emerge from the conflagration and announce a new, joint government.

The plan was executed perfectly, but only up to a point. Sharboneth double-crossed the prince; his men were much too efficient in setting the castle ablaze, and Prince Alemander (along with most of his fellow conspirators) died horribly in the fire. At about the same time, a spy planted on the general's inner staff by the equally duplicitous Alemander murdered the general and dissolved his body with a powerful acid before anyone could come to his aid.

To make matters worse, everyone had underestimated the resentment the people felt for the royal family. Once Castle Tethyr began to fall, there was no holding back the mob. In one night, the proudest, strongest castle in all the country was reduced to a smoking ruin. Everything of value—fine tapestries, plates and silverware, furniture, jewelry, weapons, clothes, armor, paintings, statues, etc.- was either stolen, burned, or just ripped apart and stomped into the dust.

As news of the fall of the royal family spread, so did the chaos. In what is now known as the "Ten Black Days of Eleint," anyone known (or even suspected) of blood connection to the royal family was put to the sword. This led to some darkly humorous moments, as social climbers who had bragged just a week before of being a sixth cousin twice removed of a royal aunt tried in vain to convince an angry mob that they were "only kidding."

The nobles who were the biggest supporters of the royal family also came under attack, and some baronial keeps fell. Local leaders who had adequately distanced themselves from the Tethyr family, or were popular enough (or feared/strong enough), survived. These surviving nobles became the initial players in the fight to decide the fate of Tethyr.

One thing was certain; any leader or type of government that too closely resembled rule under the Tethyrs would not be accepted. "Royalist" became a dirty word in Tethyr society. The power struggle continues to this day, and there is no sign of it ending anytime soon.~
@13160 = ~History of the Bell in the Depths: 

One of the great and mysterious sites in the Moonsea area, the Bell in the Depths, is connected with legendary Northkeep, an island kingdom that was the first great citadel of humankind in these cold lands. Northkeep was a great and magical city, and it was under the protection of these magics that humanity first began to press back the orc hordes and take command of the sea.

The power of Northkeep made it an obvious target for orcs, giants, and other evil races. However, these creatures were not inclined towards sea actions, and Northkeep seemed safe until the day when (according to legend) 40,000 inhuman mages, shamans, witch doctors, and priests of all foul races gathered on the northern shore of the Moonsea and began to chant, bringing the vengeance of their gods down upon the human interlopers. The gods (at least some of them) came and destroyed their priests for disturbing them, but also sank Northkeep beneath the waves.

The upper reaches of Northkeep—its slender, now-broken spires—can be seen beneath the water by boats that sail nearby. This is not attempted often, however, as the region is said to be haunted by the original defenders of Northkeep, seeking company in their watch over the Cold Lands. On fog-ridden nights the bells of the tallest towers, despite being submerged, can be heard as far away as Hillsfar.~
@13161 = ~History of the Chosen of Mystra: 

The reason why Mystra, the Goddess of Magic, invested a portion of her divine might in mortals is not known. One of the more popular theories, and one that is gaining more support in light of the goddess's other actions during that period, is that Mystra foresaw the Time of Troubles (and her own passing at the hands of Helm) and chose to give some of her power to mortals in order to ensure that her successor (the female mage Midnight, as it turned out) would have a number of nearly immortal allies in the struggle against the schemes of the gods (the now dead Bane, Myrkul, and Bhaal) who precipitated the Time of Troubles by stealing the Tablets of Fate. The theory goes on to suggest that Mystra informed Azuth at approximately the Year of the Rising Flame (0 DR), more than 1,300 years before the Time of Troubles, that some of her power must be put into the hands of mortals who would then become known as Mystra's Chosen. This power would sleep within the bodies of those mortals, allowing Mystra to call on it only with their permission. It would give the Chosen the innate ability to heal quickly, and would give them life spans far greater than those of ordinary mortals. Mystra speculated that these mortals might be able to call on her power and thereby gain some special abilities, but that these powers would not rival those of a deity. (See "Powers" below.) 

The Goddess of All Magic then began to select mortals she thought to be suitable. One of the first was the young mage Elminster, and she also singled out a promising wizard named Khelben Arunsun. Both have proved to be worthy and capable receptacles of her power, but Mystra's other early attempts to invest her power in living humans were unsuccessful, and she came to realize that only very few mortals were of stern enough substance to contain such power within themselves without being destroyed or corrupted. Even though some people aside from Elminster and Khelben may have possessed the requisite strength, it is possible that having lived for years prior to being visited by Mystra had set them on a path from which they were not able to deviate. Whatever the reason, the problem needed to be solved. To get around the difficulty, Mystra devised a plan to use herself as a vessel to breed individuals who could be nurtured and acclimated to her power from the very beginnings of their lives. 

For the father of these individuals, she picked the best example of human stock she could find: Dornal Silverhand, a nobleman and a former Harper who lived near Neverwinter. Mystra then possessed the body of Elue Shundar, a half-elven sorceress whom Dornal was already attracted to. Mystra revealed her presence and her plan to Elue, who happily and eagerly agreed to have the goddess share her body. Elue had been reluctant, but under the influence of Mystra the woman became a seductress, and Dornal found his advances being suddenly returned with great fervor. 

Dornal and Mystra/Elue were wed in the Year of Drifting Stars (760 DR). The first of seven daughters, Anastra Sylune, was born the following winter. Sylune's six sisters emerged at one-year intervals thereafter: Endue Alustriel, Ambara Dove, Ethena Astorma (she prefers the shortened "Storm" these days), Anamanue Laeral, Alassra Shentrantra (known today as the Simbul), and Er'sseae Qilue. These siblings have become known in Realmsian lore as the Seven Sisters. 

Dornal, who had been kept in the dark about his wife's true nature through the years (presumably because Mystra didn't want to risk losing his services), was disappointed and nearly distraught by the time his sixth child was born; he had always wanted sons as well as daughters. More importantly, he was seeing his wife deteriorate right before his eyes. The strain of coexisting with the goddess all these years had turned Elue into a withered shell—in essence a lich, clinging to life only because Mystra's power was within her. 

When Elue was carrying the seventh child, Dornal consulted a priest who told him his wife had been possessed by an entity of great magical power. To spare both of them any further agony, he attempted to slay his wife's physical form by severing her head from her body. 

As soon as he had done this, Mystra was forced to reveal herself to him, and she went on to explain her scheme. Just as she had worried would happen, Dornal was aghast at how he and his wife had been used by the goddess. He turned his back on the corpse of his wife, abandoned his lands and his children, and vanished into the North. Mystra bore him no ill will, and in fact protected him for the final 30 years of his life. When Dornal finally did meet his end he called out to Mystra, and the goddess granted him continued existence as her servant. Now known as the Watcher, Dornal Silverhand travels the world unseen by mortals on a continuing mission to locate candidates to swell the ranks of the Chosen and to identify possible threats to Mystra and her minions.~
@13162 = ~History of the Dales and the Elven Court:

The founding of the Dalelands long preceded the creation of any of the existing Dales by hundreds of years, and the year numbering system known as Dalereckoning is actually a commemoration of humankind being given permission to settle in the lands north and west of the Inner Sea. Most of the current Dales are relative newcomers, the older having been abandoned, destroyed, or overrun long ago. In those ancient days, when Suzail and Chondathan (now called Saerloon) were mere coastal trading posts, the elves who ruled this forest entertained a request from settlers from the East; refugees and farmers from far-off Impiltur and Damara. This request was to farm and settle the borders of the great forest Cormanthor, in particular the rich delves and dales along the rivers Arkhen and Ashaba. These newcomers did not wish to lumber or clear the inhabited forest, but only to settle on the rich territories on its edges, and unlike some other settlers (early Sembia comes to mind) were willing to ask permission.

The lords of the Elven Court granted that request in return for aid from these new Dalelanders against outside aggression, both monstrous (orcs and goblins from the lands of Thar) and human (the rising powers in Cormyr and Sembia). In commemoration of this pact, humans and elves raised the Standing Stone that is now seen where the Moonsea Ride reaches Rauthauvyr's Road, the road from Essembra to Hillsfar. It is from the date of the raising of this stone that Dalereckoning is counted. According to the pact made, the Dalesmen would only settle those regions that were unforested or unclaimed by the elves. As the elven woods receded under the axes of further invaders and settlers, old Dales perished and new ones came into being along the borders of the woods. People, both good and bad, have raised petty nations in the Dalelands since, though any one Dale that turned against the pact would have to deal with the others. Each of the Dales is a large swath of farms and fields, with a few scattered settlements and usually one central marketplace, capital, or Dale center. These centers are often, but not always, named after the Dales they are in, adding to the confusion as to what is a Daleland's territory.

The Dales are not city-states, for their largest groupings of population rate as towns at best, and they lack the defensive walls common throughout the Heartlands. They are neither true nations in the fashion of Cormyr or Sembia, and occupy a gray middle ground wherein they are nothing more, or less, than Dales.

Each Dale has slightly different laws, customs, and military organizations. Many rely on the work of charismatic heroes and adventuring companies for aid in times of trouble, and a large number of these individuals use the region as a base. This attraction for adventurers is further increased by the large number of elven and pre-elven ruins in the area and the departure of the Elven Court for Evermeet, leaving the woods open for exploration and exploitation.

The history of the Dales is filled with battles and attacks on its various members. In the Year of the Worm (1356 DR), Scardale, under the command of Lashan Aumersair, launched a number of swift attacks, conquering a number of the surrounding Dales. A coalition of forces from the others, as well as Sembia, Cormyr, and Zhentil Keep crushed the invaders and occupied Scardale. During the Time of Troubles (1358 DR/0 PR), Shadowdale was attacked by Zhentil Keep. More recently, the Dalelands have committed forces to a unified army under King Azoun IV of Cormyr to turn back the Tuigan Invasion (1360 DR).~
@13163 = ~History of the Dead Three: 'KNUCKLEBONES, SKULL BOWLING, AND THE EMPTY THRONE' 

 In ages past there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything. Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and powers alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built his power into a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. Eventually, however, he grew tired of his duties for he knew them too well. Without challenge there is nothing, and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable. 

During this dark era, there arose three powerful mortals—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who lusted after the power Jergal wielded. The trio forged an unholy pact, agreeing that they would dare to seek such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the realms they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually the trio destroyed  one of the Seven Lost Gods, and they each seized a portion of his divine essence for themselves. 

The trio then journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of noncorporeal undead, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest—the Bone Throne. 

"I claim this throne of evil," shouted Bane the tyrant. "I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger," threatened Bhaal the assassin. '''"And I shall imprison your essence for eternity," promised Myrkul the necromancer. 

Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, " The Throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish—I promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position." Before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead continued: "Who among you shall rule?"

The trio immediately fell to fighting amongst themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened. "After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office and engage in a game of skill for them?" asked Jergal. 

Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed. Jergal took the heads of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio that they would compete by bowling the skulls. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest. 

Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would get all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting as it was obvious their sport was ruined, and again Jergal intervened. "Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide so you don't have to share with the Beast?"

The trio agreed, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the players. When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.

Bane cried out triumphantly, "As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom."

Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, "But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die—even gods."

Bhaal, who finished third, demurred, "I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule Lord Bane will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul, by staying my hand."

Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and yet again only the beasts were left for him. 

And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.

@13164 = ~History of the Dragon Coast: 

The history of the Dragon Coast is the history of money, particularly the darker side of the coin. Situated on the main trade routes between the Inner Sea and the Sword Coast, these lands never coalesced into a solid, coherent nation, like Cormyr or Sembia. Instead small petty city-states have risen and fallen, powered by greed and the most powerful merchant or pirate faction of the day. 

As a result, the Dragon Coast has always been the home of the smuggler, the pirate, the rogue, and the hired killer. It has been the place where those seeking to skirt the laws of more civilized nations to the north make landfall. It is here that the Red Wizards gain their access to the Western Heartlands, and where the Cult of the Dragon launches its plots to the south. And it is here that independent secret societies and assassin guilds have their greatest power. 

The last semblance of organized resistance to this trend was the reign of Verovan, last of the kings of Westgate. The monarchy of Westgate had long worked closely with the various mercantile and pirate factions, but Verovan attempted to stem the growing power of the merchant houses and petty lords. His sudden and mysterious death without acceptable heirs in 1248 DR opened the door for much of what now is commonplace in the Dragon Coast—corruption and treachery. 

It should be noted that while Verovan's name is still venerated in these lands, better known is Immurk, the greatest of the Inner Sea Pirates, a brash and flamboyant rogue who united a pirate fleet beneath him and ruled from 1164 DR to his death in 1201 DR. Such it is in the Dragon Coast, that good people are venerated, but the power of darker rogues is imitated.~
@13165 = ~History of the Drow, The Descent: 

We know very little of the Ilythiiri, or "elves of the South," before this crucial event. Even then they were known as "dark elves," for the hue of their skins. They dwelt in the jungles and hot forests of the South. A proud, warlike, culturally advanced (some sages of other elven peoples say "decadent") folk, the Ilythiiri attacked all neighbors, including other elven tribes. Their cruel raids and depredations, ordered by warlike nobility and the clergy of their two cruel deities, Ghaunadaur and Lolth, forced elves, humans, dwarves, and others to ally against them. 

Defeated in a series of titanic magical battles, the dark elves fled into underground warrens they had earlier discovered. This event, known as "the Descent," marked the end of the drow as a surface-dwelling race.~
@13166 = ~History of the Drow, The Dark Wars: 

The warlike drow nature did not change when they escaped their surface foes during the Descent. In fact, they immediately launched a series of wars to establish territories in the Underdark. They began by stealing and seizing dwarven magical items and using them against the dwarves—establishing an enmity that is still strong today.

The drow then fought among themselves, noble against noble, priest against priestess, for rule of their new realm. This all-out war ended amid great magical explosions that brought down the roof of the largest dwarven cavern they had seized, great Bhaerynden. The ceiling collapsed entirely, burying many drow and the shattered dwarven cities. The cavern, now open to the sky, became known as the Great Rift. The surviving drow nobles gathered what people, slaves, and equipment they could seize and fled into the Underdark in search of places to dwell. "The Scattering" brought about the many rival, self-interested cities where most drow live today.~
@13167 = ~History of the Fateful Coin:

Old tales tell that luck plays a crucial role in each person's life. When each newborn baby enters into the realms, Tymora flips a coin formed from the remnants of the original goddess of luck, Tyche. Beshaba calls it in the air—the moon (heads) or the cloak (tails). If Beshaba is right, that person is cursed with misfortune for the rest of his or her days. If she's wrong, Lady Luck smiles on that child for the rest of his or her life. For some rare beings, the coin lands edge on—and these luckless few can forge their own fates, for they have more freedom over their destinies than the powers themselves.~
@13168 = ~History of the Last March of the Giants:

East of the Great Rift in the Eastern Shaar once stood a land of the titans. This empire rose at the dawn of time in Faerûn, and its lords thought to challenge the gods in their arrogance. In punishment, the powers cursed the reigning monarch of the land with fascination and his brethren with devotion. The powers then dropped a star onto the land. The impact of the fallen star created a huge valley later known as the Sea of Fallen Stars. Slowly picking up speed, the ball rolled through the titan nation and onward to the south.

Unable to contain his curiosity, the titan king ran off after the bouncing sphere and his devoted followers dutifully followed his tracks. The meteorite rolled on and on until it reached the Great Sea and vanished into the depths. The monarch dove into the sea, and, lemming-like, the entire titan race dove in after him, never to be seen again.

Ashamed at the destruction they had wrought, the powers vowed to keep both curiosity and loyalty firmly in check to avoid such disasters in the future. They have done so to this day, preventing both new ideas from being pursued with any speed and the intelligent races of Toril from ever fully cooperating.~
@13169 = ~History of the Moonsea: 

The Moonsea has a long history as the border between the elven lands to the south and the darker, more sinister lands of the Ride and Thar, home of dragons and giant and ogre tribes in great multitudes. The deep sea was an excellent barrier to the raiders, as those tribes who sought invasion had to detour around and through the lands that would eventually hold Yulash, Zhentil Keep, and Hillsfar. 

The first true settlement in Moonsea was Northkeep, a shining citadel established as a beacon of civilization and a jumping-off point for merchants seeking trade with the dwarves of the North—including not only Tethyamar, but the clans of the Cold Lands—who traded their metalwork and craft for much-needed magic. In the end, Northkeep was sunk beneath the icy waters of the Moonsea by the inhuman forces, and humankind suffered one of many setbacks in the region. 

So has been the nature of human habitation of this region since the beginning. Human settlements thrive for a few years, usually through sheer willpower and on the strength of a sharp sword, and then are overrun by goblins, orcs, dragons, beholders, or giants. Phlan has fallen and risen again. Yulash is a ruin where a decade ago there was a thriving town. Hulburg and Sulasspryn are empty hulks. Each of the cities of the Moonsea seems threatened with extinction in its turn, then is rebuilt. 

This cycle may be the reason that only the strongest and the most savage survive, even prosper, in the lands of the Moonsea. The greatest cities—Hillsfar, Mulmaster, and the impenetrable Zhentil Keep—are all ruled by evil people who control their lands with iron grips. The lesser cities, Elventree, Phlan, and Thentia, may be less evil, but have a strong, independent, almost chaotic nature. In many ways the Moonsea is a frontier, with a frontier mentality.
~
@13170 = ~History of the North—The First Flowering: 

For millennia, gold elves dwelt in Illefarn (where Waterdeep now stands) and Eaerlann (along the River Shining). From their ornate forest cities, they traded with emerging human nations like Netheril and Illusk and repulsed the attacks of the goblin races. Meanwhile, dwarven clans united as the nation of Delzoun, named for the dwarf who forged the union. The nation, existing primarily underground, extended from the Ice Mountains to the Nether Mountains. Silver Moon Pass was its western border and the Narrow Sea its eastern shore. Orcs came from north of the Spine of the World but were turned back in great slaughter by the elves. To this day, this is the homeland and stronghold for orcs and similar races.~
@13171 = ~History of the North—The Crown Wars: 

Humans immigrated in bands from the Shining Sea and up to the Sword Coast. They became seafarers, striking out across the waves to the Moonshaes, Mintarn, Ruathym, and the northern islands. Elves engaged in an unceasing war against each other, with the humans and orcs taking over the resulting ruins. Perhaps the greatest calamity to befall the Fair Folk was the Dark Disaster, a killing magic that took the form of a dark, burning cloud. It enshrouded the kingdom of Miyeritar, and when it faded away some months later, not an elf lived—nor were trees left, only an open, blasted moor: the High Moor. 

All was not dark for the elves. Although in retreat, as barbarian humans and orc hordes grew in strength, their power rose in the Elven Court and Evereska (remaining a stronghold to this day). They conceived of cooperation between dwarves, kindly humans, and other elves for mutual survival against orcs, marauding humans, and the tide of beasts (ogres, bugbears, trolls, goblins, gnolls, and other nonhuman creatures) led by the rising power of giants. Astonishingly, in at least three places—the Fallen Kingdoms and the cities of Silverymoon and Myth Drannor—they succeeded with shining grace. 

To the east, on the sandy shores of the calm and shining Narrow Sea, human fishing villages grew into small towns and then joined together as the nation of Netheril. Sages believe the fishing towns were unified by a powerful human wizard who had discovered a book of great magic power that had survived from the Days of Thunder—a book that legend calls the Nether Scrolls. Under this nameless wizard and those who followed, Netheril rose in power and glory, becoming both the first human land in the North and the most powerful. Some say this discovery marked the birth of human wizardry, since before then, mankind had only shamans and witch doctors. For over three thousand years, Netheril dominated the North, but even its legendary wizards were unable to stop their final doom.~
@13172 = ~History of the North—Recent History of the North: 

In the waning summer months of 1367, an immense orc horde descended from the Spine of the World, intent on winding its way south into the trade lands of the North. This force of orcs, led by King Greneire, surged its way south between the Moonwood and the Cold Wood, stopping just outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. 

King Obould, orc ruler of the Citadel of Many Arrows, was terrified at the prospect of another orc horde, despite the fact that he knew they should be working together against the humans of the North and the spawn of Hellgate Keep. His tribal shamans, however, had been predicting a treacherous fall of the citadel—and they'd told the king that he'd be deposed by other orcs. 

Thus, it was a dark day when King Greneire and his horde of 150,000 orcs appeared on the plains outside the Citadel of Many Arrows. King Obould announced to his followers that this horde had been sent to dislodge them from their home and send them out to be scavengers among the plains. He vowed that, with Gruumsh as his witness, the Citadel of Many Arrows would slaughter these treacherous orcs "like elves during a festival." 

For four months, the 40,000 orcs within the citadel held their ground. Assault after assault was mounted against the high walls of the garrison, but the attacking orcs were losing far more than the defenders. Still, the living conditions within the walls—never too good to begin with—created losses of their own. 

The battle for the Citadel of Many Arrows culminated during the first week of Uktar. As another light blanket of snow sought to bury the gathered orcs, King Greneire threw his entire remaining army at the citadel, bursting its gates and pitting orc against orc in a flurry of swords. As the two orc kings sought one another out along the ramparts, the citadel began to burn. 

The orcs that survive the battle still speak of the superhuman prowess of the two kings as they battled one another before their troops. Finally, however, King Obould ran Greneire through with his long sword, but Obould was severely wounded by the time Greneire had breathed his last breath. The orcs erupted into battle once again, and no one is quite certain what became of King Obould. 

It was through the smoke and snow that the victors of the conflict emerged: the dwarves of Clan Warcrown along with a contingent of troops from Silverymoon. Charging in through the shattered gates, these new attackers quickly routed the exhausted orcs of the citadel, sending them scurrying off into the wilderness. 

King Emerus Warcrown now rules the Citadel of Many Arrows, though the dwarves now call the city by its old name of Felbarr. Most in the North still tend to refer to the city as the Citadel, however, waiting to see if it can withstand the next orc horde. King Warcrown has put out a call for all dwarves to help defend the citadel, and news of a new vein of gold and silver is spreading rapidly through dwarven communities.
~
@13173 = ~History of the North—The Elven Exodus:

This era left behind elven strongholds ripe for pillaging by humans and orcs. When elves chose to leave the North and travel to Evermeet, their works quickly disappeared, leaving only places like the Old Road and a ruined port in the High Forest to mark Eaerlann's passing. And yet it was not only the elves who would disappear from their long-held homes; the human nation of Netheril also stood on the brink of history.

Doom for Netheril came in the form of a desert, devouring the Narrow Sea and spreading to fill its banks with dry dust and blowing sand. Legend states that when the great wizards of Netheril realized their land was lost, they abandoned it and their countrymen, fleeing to all corners of the world and taking the secrets of wizardry with them. More likely, this was a slow migration that began three thousand years ago and reached its conclusion fifteen hundred years later.

Whatever the truth, wizards no longer dwelled in Netheril. To the north, the once-majestic dwarven stronghold of Delzoun fell upon hard days. Then the orcs struck. Orcs have always been foes in the North, surging out of their holes every few tens of generations when their normal haunts can no longer support their burgeoning numbers. This time they charged out of their caverns in the Spine of the World, poured out of abandoned mines in the Graypeaks, screamed out of lost dwarfholds in the Ice Mountains, raged forth from crypt complexes in the Nether Mountains, and stormed upward from the bowels of the High Moon Mountains. Never before or since has there been such an outpouring of orcs. Delzoun crumbled before this onslaught and was driven in on itself. Netheril, without its wizards, was wiped from the face of history. The Eaerlann elves alone withstood the onslaught and, with the aid of the treants of Turlang and other unnamed allies, were able to stave off the final days of their land for yet a few centuries more.

In the east, Eaerlann built the fortress of Ascalhorn and turned it over to refugees from Netheril as Netherese followers built the town of Karse in the High Forest. The fleeing Netherese founded Llorkh and Loudwater. Others wandered the mountains, hills, and moors north and west of the High Forest, becoming ancestors of the Uthgardt and founders of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar.~
@13174 = ~History of the North—The Spread of Humankind:

The adaptable humans made use of magic they could seize or learn from the Proud Peoples to defeat all enemies, breaking (for a time) the power of giants and orcs. Waterdeep was founded. The last of the pureblood elves died out, a result of continued marriages with humans.

In the far west, men also dwelled—wise, clever primitives called the Ice Hunters. They lived simple lives on the coast since time beyond reckoning, countless generations before Netheril's first founders set foot on the Narrow Sea's western shore. Yet this peaceful folk fell prey to another invasion from the south: crude longships that carried a tall, fair-haired, warlike race who displaced the Ice Hunters from their ancestral lands.

This race, known as the Northmen, spread farms and villages along the coast from the banks of the Winding Water to the gorges of the Mirar. Northmen warriors drove the simple Ice Hunters farther and farther north, forced the goblinkin back into their mountain haunts, and instigated the last Council of Illefarn. Within five hundred years of the Northmen's arrival, Illefarn was no more—its residents had migrated to Evermeet.

From the Coast, Northmen sailed westward, claiming and establishing colonies on the major western islands of Ruathym and Gundarlun, eventually spreading to all the islands in the northern sea. Others migrated northward, past the Spine of the World, and became the truly savage barbarians of Icewind Dale.

In the centuries that followed, Ascalhorn became Hellgate Keep when it fell into the hands of fiends, and Eaerlann collapsed under the attack of a new orc horde. The elves fled southeast, joining with Northmen, Netherese descendants, and dwarves to form what would later be known as the Fallen Kingdom. This realm was short-lived and collapsed under the next orcish invasion—though in dying, it dealt the goblin races a blow from which they have yet to recover.~
@13175 = ~History of the North—The Might of Men:

Along the coast, in what was once the elven community of Illefarn, humanity was once again rising in power. Merchants from the south, tribesmen from the North, and seafarers from western islands had created a village around a trading post on a deep-water harbor, first known as Nimoar's Hold after the Uthgardt chieftain whose tribe seized and fortified the ramshackle village. Nimoar and his successors, known as War Lords, led the men of Waterdeep (as it had become known to ship captains) in a slowly losing battle against the trolls. In a final, climactic battle, the trolls breached the aging palisade and all seemed lost—until the magic of Ahghairon of Silverymoon turned luck against the trolls, destroying and scattering them.

Ahghairon, heir to the heritage and learning of Netheril, stayed in Waterdeep, and in his 112th year he again saved the city—this time from itself. In so doing, he created the Lords of Waterdeep. The city grew into the greatest in the North, possibly in all Faerûn. With Waterdeep as a firm anchor, civilization forged cautiously into the wilderness. Illuskan (now Luskan) was taken from the orcs. Loudwater, Llorkh, Triboar, Longsaddle, Secomber, and other towns were settled by pioneers from Waterdeep, sponsored by Waterdhavian merchant families.

Though it's been centuries since the last orc invasion, there's still constant strife. Barbarians harass merchants, travelers, and towns, the seas swim with Northmen pirates, and wars have marred the land in recent years. Luskan, now a fierce merchant city known to harbor—and support—pirates, waged a war with the island realm of Ruathym over an act of piracy against one of the few legitimate Luskan merchant ships. The war raged for nearly a year, with Ruathym slowly losing ground. When it appeared Luskan would finally win the naval war and land on the island itself, the Lords' Alliance entered the fray. They threatened war against Luskan if the skirmishes didn't stop immediately. Unable to fight a two-front war efficiently, Luskan canceled its invasion plans.

Tensions between Luskan and Ruathym are still high, and their ships are often seen taking potshots at each other as they pass, often just a wave or two away from each other. The government of Ruathym has recently been sending adventurers into the hills of its island realm, looking for mercenaries who are killing merchants, farmers, and woodsmen. Ruathym believes Luskan still has a presence on the island, trying to win through subversion and terrorism what it could not accomplish through war.

To the far north, the Ten Towns have finished rebuilding after being nearly destroyed by the monstrous forces of Akar Kessel. With help from the tundra barbarians living nearby, they've built and repaired their cities, replanted the sparse foliage, and—most importantly—replenished the morale of their citizens. A recent trader who passed through the area carrying 17 wagons of rare oak lumber said that it was nearly impossible to determine who's a barbarian and who isn't. "They're living together!" he reported in amazement.~
@13176 = ~History of the North—1368, Year of the Banner: 

 As the dwarves settled in for the winter in their reclaimed city of Felbarr, a group of Zhentarim-sponsored adventurers broke into Great Worm Cavern, slaying Elrem the Wise, shaman leader of the Great Worm tribe. As the tribe's warriors descended into the ranks of the evil adventurers, teleportation magic spirited at least three of those responsible—as well as a vast amount of treasure stolen from Elrem—to safety. 

According to Themrin, the tribe's present shaman, Elrem promised to "watch over the tribe in spirit now that my mortal form is destroyed." Despite the reassuring words of Elrem, the tribe suffered through an oppressive winter that included both heavy snow, scarce game, and low morale. 

Trusted visitors to the barbarian encampment report that Themrin and Gweshen "Ironhand" Talistars are wearing some form of armor made from the scales of Elrem. This use of their former shaman's body as "protection" was supposedly ordained through a dream vision. The armor appears as little more than a supple leather armor, but seems to deflect blows and protect as well as full plate mail. 

Nesme reported a drastic rise in the number of troll attacks in the Evermoors, and various sources confirm that something is driving the trolls out of the moors. Whatever is behind the trolls' exodus is destined to remain a mystery for the remainder of the year, as adventuring parties expend themselves against the never-ending supply of trolls that are fleeing the bog. 

In the most surprising move of the year, the Blue Bear Tribe, led by the shaman/chieftain Tanta Hagara, marched on the fiend-ridden fortress of Hellgate Keep. While a brief struggle for political control of the city was reported by various sources, Tanta Hagara emerged as the new ruler of the city.
~
@13177 = ~History of the North—1369, Year of the Gauntlet:

The tumultuous climate of Hellgate Keep continued to provide adventuring activity. A group of Harpers infiltrated the city using cloaking magic and revealed that Tanta Hagara was actually an annis. This revelation did nothing to hamper the Blue Bear's respect for their powerful chieftain however, and the city responded to the unmasking by attacking caravans en route to Sundabar. In addition, a few expeditionary forces of tanar'ri were sent to harass the Citadel of the Mists, Sundabar, and Silverymoon. Tanta Hagara informed her "loyal troops" that gates existed in these cities that could allow other tanar'ri to "join us in the glorious battles to come as we take control of all of the North!"

Alustriel cast powerful magical spells in the defense of Silverymoon against the raiding tanar'ri, and the city itself suffered no damage from their attack. The Mistmaster of the Citadel of the Mists likewise aided in the defense of his citadel, though reports still rage about the assistance of the treants of the High Forest.

Sundabar suffered from Hellgate Keep's attack, as the fiends broke through the walls and raised havoc along the city streets. While adventurers battled the fiends, Helm Dwarffriend led a large contingent of the city guard to drive the remainder from Sundabar. Still, the fiends from Hellgate Keep left the city with the satisfaction of knowing that it was burning in their wake. Within two days, however, the fires were extinguished, and Sundabar has since rebuilt from the attack.

By mid Eleasias, rumors that Turlang, the powerful treant who resides in the northern High Forest, was actively defending the woodlands near the Citadel of the Mists reached the ears of Tanta Hagara, the hag-ruler of Hellgate Keep. News that Turlang was aiding the Mistmaster did not escape her notice, and the belief that the Citadel of the Mists was holding an extra-planar artifact only added to the hag's interest.

Tanta assembled a large force consisting of more than 100 tanar'ri and other fiends as well as 500 members of the Blue Bear tribe to raze the Citadel of the Mists. But as the evil forces marched their way into the High Forest, the Mistmaster put his own plan into motion. Two Harper agents, a bard named Cryshana Fireglen and a priest of Mystra known as Spellviper, infiltrated Hellgate Keep disguised as members of the Blue Bear tribe. Each carried with them part of an extra-planar artifact called the Gatekeeper's Crystal.

The Gatekeeper's Crystal is an artifact shaped like a three-pointed star that is made of onyx and an unknown metal that entwines itself through the gem. Each point of the star is a separate piece that can be combined together to create the artifact or separated to form three powerful magical items. While the crystal can be used in different manners, it was primarily created to bring down wards, including mythals and other powerful protections. According to legend, it was created by a powerful lich who used it to render clerics powerless, stripping them of their ability to turn undead and nullifying necromantic magic within a 50-mile radius.

The Mistmaster had a different use for the Gatekeeper's Crystal, but he needed volunteers to aid him in placing two shards of the crystal at precise locations within the warded city of Hellgate Keep. In particular, he needed two people who would be willing to trade their lives to exterminate the fiends of Hellgate Keep forever. Spellviper and Cryshana agreed to the suicide mission. Holding the pieces of the crystal, the two Harpers waited for the Mistmaster to activate the magic with his third piece, initiating the magic that would tear Hellgate Keep asunder. When a blazing beam of purple energy illuminated the skies over the keep, no one within the fiend's stronghold had time to wonder what was happening.

The power of the Gatekeeper's Crystal forced the wards to cascade upon the city, causing an implosion that shook the ground for more than 100 miles. As quickly as the wards surrounding Hellgate Keep collapsed, the crystal released the magical energy in an explosion that leveled every building in the city, leaving nothing but fist-sized chunks of rocks where Hellgate Keep once stood. Not a living creature stirred in the remains; all was silent and lifeless.

The force of tanar'ri from Hellgate Keep was unsure what had happened but had felt the tremor when the Gatekeeper's Crystal had been activated. They were fighting for their own lives, however, as the treants, korred, centaurs, satyrs, dryads, and other creatures of the High Forest—including defenders of the Citadel of the Mists—battered them into the moist earth. One of the North's most notable rulers fell in the battle, however, but he took at least six tanar'ri with him to his grave. Faurael Blackhammer, the lord protector of Triboar, fell alongside his troops near the conclusion of the conflict.

Within weeks after the final battle with Hellgate Keep, treants blocked passage farther north at the joining of the Heart-blood and Delimbiyr rivers. While the treants care little for hunters and adventurers passing through the area, all caravans seeking passage north to Sundabar have been repulsed—and this is not a matter that the treants wish to negotiate.

In another mishap blamed on Turlang, Tumstone Pass was blocked by a tremendous avalanche. This final calamity sealed the Upvale from any major force of men. Travel into the area formerly occupied by Hellgate Keep is now limited to adventurers and other brave travelers.

The Mistmaster has been questioned repeatedly by some of the most powerful wizards in the realms, including Elminster of Shadowdale and Khelben Arunsun, about the current location of the Gatekeeper's Crystal. Most sources claim that the pieces of the crystal have been scattered amongst the planes again, but no one is certain.

Near Nesme, the source of the trolls' exodus is revealed. Fog and cloud giants have taken up residence in the moor, driving the trolls from the giants' new "homeland." While it's unknown how many giants have taken up residence in the High Moor, estimates range up to several hundred. A thick mist continually hangs in the air of the Evermoors now, even more persistent and thick than the mist before the giants' arrival. Many believe that these new mists are the work of the cloud giants, but none can be certain.

Alustriel of Silverymoon sent a detachment of guards to investigate the eastern borders of the moor, and the guards returned with news that a gathering of around 20 fog giants who were "of good nature and quite friendly" had taken up residence in a formerly troll-infested area.

Guards from neighboring Nesme were not so fortunate, however, running into a clan of violent, boulder-hurling fog and cloud giants who nearly decimated their unit. In addition, a group of adventurers crawled into Nesme with terrible burns, reporting that they had run into a black dragon at a fog giant encampment. Overall, it appears that both good and evil giants now call the moor their home.~
@13178 = ~History of the North—Return of the Beast (1367—?): 

Sages, philosophers, historians, and priests alike feel an ill-boding in the chill air. They predict a slow change over the next decade, but within the lifetime of men born on the first day of this age. They believe that the beasts that once ruled the land plan to return to claim what's rightfully theirs, imprisoning and enslaving the crowns. Where elves once reigned, men now rule, but their hold—as true for all civilizations before—is tenuous at best.

@13179 = ~History of the North—137O, Year of the Tankard: 

Even before spring has graced the Savage North, reports of treants massing in the High Forest have reached all of the northern cities. It seems that all of the creatures of the forest have mobilized to restore the High Forest after the fall of Hellgate Keep. Something must still reside below the ruins of Hellgate Keep, however, for the Company of the Jaded Heart never emerged from the depths below the city. The treants have since blocked entrance into the ruins, sealing whatever evil still lurks within far below the sight of man. 

But there is other activity in the North as well. Luskan still flirts with war, tempting neighboring cities and yet staying just below the wrath of Waterdeep. The barbarians still brew in the north, quick to take offense at innocent incursions into their sacred holdings. Rumors of Zhentarim agents scouring the Fallen Lands for powerful magic from long-lost Netheril continue to circulate. And adventurers still abound in the Savage Frontier.

@13180 = ~History of the Red Ravens: 

One of the few long-standing mercenary companies that operate in Cormyr, the Red Ravens have a strength on paper of 110 swords, but can easily triple that number with new hires if they get a sufficiently large contract. They have been kept on retainer by the government of Cormyr with the stated purpose of cleaning out the Stonelands to the north. They have been moderately successful in this goal, but the Stonelands are still far from being a safe territory. 

The Red Ravens are commanded by Rayanna the Rose, a veteran of the Horde crusade. They are noted for their honesty and trustworthiness, as they do not wish to jeopardize their royal charter. Most of their troops are armed with studded leather and carry long swords. They charge 200 gold pieces per week for the services of their 110-being unit. Their symbol is a red raven amulet.

@13181 = ~History of the Sisters of Light and Darkness:

This was the birth of the world and the heavens. After Lord Ao created Realmspace, there was a period of timeless nothingness, a misty realm of shadows before light and dark were separate entities. Within this dim chaos stalked 13 lords of shadow, the Shadevari—whether they came form elsewhere or are children of the shadow itself, none can say.

Eventually this primordial essence coalesced into twin beautiful goddesses who were yin and yang to each other; they were so close they thought of themselves as one being. The Two-Faced Goddess created the heavenly bodies of the crystal sphere and together infused them with life to form the Earthmother, Chauntea. (Although Chauntea has since contracted her essence to encompass only Abeir-Toril, in the beginning she embodied all matter in Realmspace.)  This new universe was lit by the face of the silver-haired goddess, who called herself Selûne, and darkened by the welcoming tresses of the raven-haired goddess, Shar, but no heat or fire existed within it.

Chauntea begged for warmth so that she could nurture life and living creatures upon the planets that were her body and limbs, and the two sisters-Who-Were-One become divided, as for the first time they were of two minds. Silvery Selûne contested with her dark sister over whether or not to bring further life to the worlds. During this great conflagration, the gods of war, disease, murder, and death, among others, were created from residues of the deific battle. At one point during the battle, Selûne seized the advantage and reached across time and space to a land of eternal fire. Fighting the pain of the blaze, which burned her sorely, she broke off a fragment of that ever-living flame and ignited one of the heavenly bodies so that it burned in the sky and warmed Chauntea.

Incensed, Shar redoubled her attack on her injured twin and began to snuff out all light and heat throughout the crystal sphere. Again Selûne gave of herself and tore the divine essence of magic from her body, flinging it desperately at her sister in defense of life in the sphere. This essence entered Shar, ripped an equal portion of energy from her, and reformed behind her as the goddess of magic, known now as Mystra, but then as Mystryl. Though Mystryl was composed of both light and dark magic, she favored her first mother Selûne initially, allowing the silver goddess to win an uneasy truce with her more powerful, dark twin. Consumed by bitterness at her defeat, Shar vowed eternal revenge.

The twin goddesses contested for eons as life struggled into existence on Toril and the other planets under Chauntea's watchful gaze. Shar remained powerful, but bitterly alone, while Selûne waxed and waned in power, often drawing strength from her allied Daughters and sons and like-minded immigrant deities. Over time, Shar grew strong again, aided by the shadevari who preferred night to blinding light and who stalked the realms seeking to meld light and dark into shadowy chaos once again. Shar's plot to reform the world after her own desires was undone when Azuth, the High One, formerly the greatest of all mortal spellcasters and now consort to Mystra (incarnate successor to Mystryl), found a way to imprison the shadevari in a pocket-sized crystal sphere located beyond the edges of the world by creating the illusion of a realm of shadows. The Lords of Shadow were drawn to investigate, and before they discovered the trick, Azuth imprisoned the shadevari with the Shadowstar, a key of shadows forged by Gond. The High Lord then hurled the key into the endless reaches of the cosmos allowing life to flourish on in Chauntea's loving hands.~
@13182 = ~History of the Unicorn Run: 

Bards and sages pass down the tale that the headwaters of the Unicorn Run are, in truth, the Font of Life and a cradle of fecundity. Each natural race is said to have emerged from the womb of Chauntea onto Toril at the river's source and then traveled down the Unicorn Run to the outside world. Some say that a daughter of Chauntea resides at the river's source to usher the newborns into the world, while others claim that Shialla midwifes the process.

Regardless of the truth, the elves, korreds, and halflings all agree that the Unicorn Run is sacred to life and a site of incredible purity. As a result, all three races have strong taboos about extended trips up the run, for if the river is ever fouled, then no new races will ever be born on Toril again.~
@13183 = ~History of the Valley of the Gods: 

It is said that even the powers must cavort and amuse themselves once in a great while. Far to the north of the Spine of the World is the Valley of the Gods. A paradise unequaled on this world or in the planes, this playground of the gods is not meant for mortals. Any mortal who reaches the Valley becomes a deity, for only deities may exist in the Valley. Far too many mortals with delusions of grandeur have thrown away the pleasures of this side of the Spine and their kingdoms in this world, only to break their backs searching for the legendary Valley of the Gods.~
@13184 = ~History of the Vast: 

Two millennia ago the Vast was Vastar, the orcish lands. These were the breeding grounds of the goblin hordes that would spill eastward and cross the Dragon Reach in ramshackle boats to raid the elves. The orcs were overthrown by invading dwarves, who established the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. It was during this time that the first humans came to the Vast, including the mage Maskyr. 

The rule of the dwarves occurred against a backdrop of constant war with the orcs, such that there were perhaps only 40 years of true peace for the Realm of the Glimmering Swords. The dwarves were overrun by the orcs, and they escaped extinction only through the aid of human and elven allies. The remaining dwarves left the region to the newly arriving humans and retreated to the east, to the south, and to isolated and hidden communities within the Vast. 

The most successful of the humans were the adventurers whose hunger was sated by gold and whose thirst was slaked by great deeds. This was the Time of the Glorious Fools, and there are those who will argue that it is still that age, as adventurers still rule the cities of Calaunt and Ravens Bluff. The orcs today are contained, if not conquered, and trade has grown up in the lands of the Vast. However, for many individuals with adventuring blood, it is still a wilderness in which one may prove one's worth.~
@13185 = ~History of the Western Heartlands:

The history of the Western Heartlands is a history of endless battles and destroyed empires. In ancient times these were the lands of the Fallen Kingdom of Illefarn, the Lost Kingdom of Man, and rumored Netheril. In more recent history, the land has been fertilized with blood and bone as forces from the Empires of the Sands surged northward, the evil peoples within Dragonspear and the Goblin Marches spilled forth, and mercenary companies moved to and fro in the service of one petty warlord after another. Recent battles leveled the Way Inn and threatened Daggerford. Even the Time of Troubles did not leave this desolate land unmarked—Bhaal himself perished at Boareskyr Bridge, and the waters it passes over have remained poisoned to this day.

The cities of the Western Heartlands are strong, independent, and varied. They are also strongly motivated by trade, and listen harder to the ringing of gold than the call of battle. But something else prospers in the open land—freedom and opportunity. No nation lays claim on the Western Heartlands to land beyond that which their armies can control, and no warlord can make demands beyond the swing of his axe. Small holds and castles regularly spring up, only to be knocked down by invading forces, or abandoned after a generation or two. Lost dungeons and secret citadels lie scattered throughout the land, and this rugged frontier presents more than enough opportunities for adventurers.~
@13186 = ~History of the Zhentarim, Two Zhents' Worth: 

Much confusion exists in the realms regarding Zhentil Keep and the (not-so) secret society known as the Black Network or Zhentarim. The two are closely tied, such that a speaker may refer to one when meaning the other and still be clearly understood. In general, both mean trouble.

Zhentil Keep is a walled, independent city on the western shores of the Moonsea. It is one of the most evil cities in the realms, a blight on the North, and a haven for Evil groups, plotting manipulators, dark religions, and foul practices. Its rulers seek to dominate the lands around it, including the Dragonspine Mountains, Yulash, Voonlar, and the neighboring Dales. The city of Zhentil Keep and its armies (known as the Zhentilar, to make matters more confusing) have destroyed Teshendale, come close to destroying Daggerdale, and for a long time had an agent ruling Shadowdale. 

The Zhentarim is an organization of evil priests, wizards, and inhuman creatures bent on controlling all the trade and power between the Sword Coast (meaning Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep) and the Moonsea (including the intervening lands of Cormyr and Anauroch). Its aims in the Moonsea area are the same as Zhentil Keep's, and the two factions work hand-in-glove, often sharing the same membership. The Zhentarim have a more far-reaching effect than Zhentil Keep, though, and have agents throughout the North.

In addition, the Zhentarim are not limited to Zhentil Keep itself, and maintain a number of fortified outposts. Their rulership has spread with the passing years. In addition to being the dominant force in Zhentil Keep, the Zhentarim control the Citadel of the Raven and Darkhold, two important castle complexes. Over the years, more power has been moving away from Zhentil Keep (filled with a lot of unknown and untrustworthy flunkies) and into these more secure areas. 

Within the Dalelands area, Zhentarim smells of Zhentil Keep and vice versa, but in reality not every Keeper (yet another name for a native of Zhentil Keep) is of the Black Network, and not every agent of the Zhentarim is from Zhentil Keep. Adventurers should watch who they trust as a result.

@13187 = ~History of Ulgarth:  

Ulgarth was settled by the great empire of Raurin, in the height of its power. When the empire was destroyed, it endured centuries of barbarism. Warchiefs united the country several times during this period. They fought many skirmishes with other barbarians, particularly those in Durpar and Var the Golden. In 202 DR, the barbarian tribes were nearly wiped out by the forces of Mulhorand.

In 348 DR, a group of outlaws, fleeing the justice of the priest-kings of Mulhorand, came to Ulgarth. There they found a fertile, almost unoccupied land. They settled down, and began raising children and crops. This new society in Ulgarth gradually grew in power, while its neighbors grew apace. But while Durpar grew as a result of its commerce and its philosophy of balance, Ulgarth concentrated on agrarian pursuits. The Ulgarthians developed a highly structured caste system of lords and peasants. In 1002 DR, the centuries' long skirmishes between Durpar and Ulgarth came to an end, as the two countries finally reached a balance of power. There were too many centuries of warfare between the countries for them to completely trust each other. With their mutual border well defended on both sides, both countries have given up on the idea of conquering the other.

Trade between the Ulgarth and the Shining Lands has become a vital factor to both nations. Ulgarth produces many of the items that Durparians trade throughout the world. In return, Durpar trades many exotic items to Ulgarth. Of course, the Durparian merchants usually get the better of any trade. The current king, Drasna the Fortunate, has continued his predecessor's policy of non-aggression with the Durparians.

@13188 = ~History of Waterdeep: 

Waterdeep was used as a trading site for trade activities between northern tribesmen and southern merchants more than two millennia ago. By 1,000 years ago, permanent farms had sprung up in the area. The first mention of a Waterdeep (not as a city, but as a collection of warlords) occurs only 400 years ago. The city was truly established as a going concern by 1032 DR, the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep, and the date from which Northreckoning is counted. The city grew spectacularly, such that by 1248 DR both the City of the Dead and the guilds had been developed. The guildmasters seized control soon afterwards, ushering in a period of unrest and bitter conflict known as the Guildwars. The Guildwars ended only when the two surviving guildmasters brought in their own period of misrule. It was only in 1273 DR that the present system of government (or lack thereof) was instituted. This was the year that the Magisters were established and the secret Lords of Waterdeep were firmly reestablished. Since that time, the city has continued to grow and prosper. Humankind and other races come from all over the realms to earn hard coin in the City of Splendors. Over the years these successful merchants have set up guilds and themselves become nobility, supporting the secretive Lords of Waterdeep who police the city fairly, yet with a light hand, by means of the superb city guard (soldiers), city watch (police), and over 20 black-robed magistrates. As a result, Waterdeep is a place tolerant of different races, religions, and lifestyles. This in turn has encouraged commerce, and Waterdeep has grown into a huge, eclectic city.~
@13189 = ~History of Waterdeep— Age 0, Trademoots and Pioneers: 

Few now know the true history of this great city, which had its beginnings over a thousand years ago, when the North was truly what Southerners still sneeringly call it: "the Savage North." In those days, most of the North was covered with vast, tall forests of ancient green, and inhabited by dwarves and goblinkind (in the most northern mountains and foothills) and elves (in widely scattered forest enclaves everywhere else). A few primitive human tribes lived along the Sword Coast, fishing, hunting and gathering in spring and fall to trade their furs with vessels sailing in from the south for merchant's jewelry, metal tools, and the occasionally-available weapon or two. In the spring, these vessels came primarily to cut and take huge trees for shipbuilding, trees being no longer available in such large sizes farther south.

In the fall, the vessels came in to cut timber for their own repairs, or to take on a cargo of wood if the misfortunes of trading had left their holds low or empty. Most of these trademoots were at a certain place where there was a great natural deepwater harbor, protected from the sea by a rocky spur of land, an arm of an isolated coastal crag, or a rocky island beyond it.~
@13190 = ~History of Waterdeep— Age I, The Rise of the Warlords:

Over the years, the forest was cut back farther and farther from the shore, and tribes began to stay most of the year there, farming the cleared land. The wiser among them claimed and controlled some of the timber in order to trade for more weaponry and tools. Such claims angered many who found the squatters rich from frequent trade, and brought attacks from land and sea, the more warlike tribes slaughtering the more sedentary settlers. Noted among these tribes was that led by Nimoar, a chieftain who ordered his people to seize the farms, crude wooden docks, trading sheds, and storage barns built up around the bay. They settled there themselves, and erected a log palisade within an earthen embankment to protect the holdings. After several abortive pirate and tribal raids, Nimoar's people thrived in their new home, a fledgling town referred to as "the town of Water-deep."

Farther north, orc tribes had outgrown their mountain strongholds. Attempts to expand underground met with fierce dwarven resistance (although many small gnomish colonies were overwhelmed and wiped out), and the orcs spread out on the surface of the land, coming south and down out of the mountains, hurling their seemingly endless numbers against all who stood in their path. Here and there elven enclaves held out, but the push southward displaced many other northern inhabitants, including the "everlasting ones" (trolls), who came down into the newly-cleared lands northeast of Nimoar's Hold, those lands now known as the Trollmoors. Nimoar died of old age during this time of increasing danger. Younger War Lords led the men of Waterdeep (for so the ship-captains called the harbor) in battles against the trolls. There were many bloody struggles between men and trolls for a decade, until the magic of a Northern youth named Ahghairon turned the fortunes of war against the trolls, and the "everlasting ones" were destroyed or scattered. Ahghairon rose slowly in skill and power with the passage of years, until he became a great mage. He discovered a supply of potions of longevity (or learned the art of making such), for he lived on, still physically a man in his prime, for decade upon decade.

Fearing further attacks, the men of Waterdeep raised a small keep on the slopes of Mount Waterdeep above their farms, where fire arrows from on high could defend against attacking trolls. Many outlying tribes who had come to the settlement for safety from the trolls stayed, and expanded the walls with new farms several times. War Lords ruled the Free City of Waterdeep, holding it independent and increasingly wealthy as years passed.~
@13191 = ~History of Waterdeep— Age III, The Bloody Reign of the Guildmasters:

There was great turmoil in the City as the Guildmasters argued amongst themselves as to who should govern the City, and more than one merchant of power was found murdered. Groups of liveried bodyguards appeared openly armed on the streets, accompanying their masters, and two very troubled months passed as they bickered and parleyed (and occasionally dueled in the streets). At last, they decided that all Masters should rule Waterdeep together, in a council. The lesser nobles and many townsfolk protested, saying that the Lords ruled by right and by the people's consent. The Guildmasters, however, said that the Lords had not been seen since Ahghairon's death, and that they must have been golems or zombies, controlled by Ahghairon to conceal his lone rule—and indeed, the Lords were silent and unseen, and continued to be so.

In truth, the Lords were real men and women whose identities had been compromised, over the years, by certain curious Guildmasters who had ordered them slain by their own closemouthed, loyal servants following Ahghairon's death. The only Lords still surviving (those who had remained secret) were Baeron, a woodworker, and Shilam, an apprentice wizard. These surviving Lords kept very quiet, and waited. The Guildmasters thought all the living Lords of the City had been eliminated, and took firm rule over Waterdeep.

The Guildmasters ruled Waterdeep for only six years ere their self-interested squabbling led to bloodshed. Open quarrels and a few murders quickly erupted into a brief but vicious series of street fights and midnight attacks. This strife, ofttimes termed "the Guildwars" by sages (although it was never as long-drawn-out or so formal as to be called a "war" when it was taking place), left all but two Guildmasters dead, most of the City's best minds stilled, and much of the City's gold wasted or plundered with the Guilds in disarray.

The surviving Guildmasters were Lhorar Gildeggh of the Shipwrights and Ehlemm Zoar of the Gemcutters. These two—ruthless manipulators both—were well-matched and could not overcome each other, though their private armies clashed often in the streets. At length, they sickened of bloodshed, after many from both families were dead in the gutters, and agreed to rule together. Two thrones were set up in Castle Waterdeep, and from then the two argued bitterly over this and that, and the City was a place of tension and fear. All matters, including the recognition of new Guildmasters to rule the "headless" guilds, had to come before the Two Lords Magister, as Lhorar and Ehlemm were called. Few matters were settled.~
@13192 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age II, The Lords' Rule Begins: 

In his 112th winter, Ahghairon had a sharp disagreement with Raurlor, who was then Warlord of Waterdeep. Raurlor wanted to use Waterdeep's acquired wealth and strength-of-arms to create a Northern empire, with Waterdeep its capital (and Raurlor its ruler), and gathered armies for the purpose. Ahghairon defied him before all the people, and Raurlor ordered the mage to be chained. Ahghairon magically struck aside all who sought to lay hands on him. In a fury Raurlor struck at the mage with his own blade. Ahghairon rose into the air, just out of reach, and, as the infuriated Warlord slashed repeatedly at his rising feet, gestured. Raurlor's blade transmuted in his hand, from steel into a hissing serpent, which promptly bit him. The Warlord died of the venom before the shocked people assembled there. Ahghairon then gathered all the captains of Waterdeep's army, and all the seniors of the families of Waterdeep. While runners sought to bring them to the Castle, flames roared and crackled in the Warlord's empty chair-of-state at Ahghairon's bidding, so that no one sat there. Then at a gesture from the mage, the flames were gone as though they had never been, leaving the chair unmarked. Ahghairon seated himself, then, and proclaimed himself the first Lord of Waterdeep, saying that henceforth wisdom and not armed might would rule in the city. He would gather some few—in secret—to rule as Lords with him, masked and disguised when they appeared to the people, but equal to him in authority and free of coercion by any, himself included. These Lords were to be drawn from all walks of life in the city, and could serve as long as they wished. 

The people heard, and agreed, and for the next two hundred years, Ahghairon ruled Waterdeep with his unknown fellow Lords. Over the years, the masked Lords were a group of sometimes five, six, or seven, who appeared seldom and said little. Some whispered that they were Ahghairon's servants, or even magical automatons controlled by the Old Mage. Still, Ahghairon's justice was swift and fair, his laws good, his guardsmen polite and just as ready to help as apprehend, and the people approved. The years passed in peace and prosperity. The North was opened to humans. Roads built under Ahghairon's direction linked it together, from the ruins of "the Fallen Kingdom," which had been shattered by goblin races' attacks before men were numerous in the North, to the cities that would later become Amn. Waterdeep grew fivefold in size and wealth. From all over the realms, folk began to come to the "Crown of the North," drawn by money—and among them came those who rob, cheat, and steal. When word of doings extending beyond simple theft to deception-in-workmanship and the appearance of many fly-by-night impostor craftsmen reached Ahghairon's ears, he called together the senior merchants, "the Noble Ones," and suggested that they form guilds as was done in the far South to police the unscrupulous of their own professions. Some resisted, or were furious, but most saw the advantages of such an arrangement, particularly if they were free to set matters up themselves, and not have less favorable arrangements forced upon them. The Guilds were created forthwith. Twice more the city walls were expanded, as Waterdeep continued to grow in size and prosperity. Its merchants traveled the world over, bringing back exotic goods from afar, and spreading word of the city's wealth to remote lands. In the South, some listened with an eye to conquest or at least plunder, but swords were already out in those southern lands in a time of widespread strife, and no invaders came. 

Ahghairon's health eventually failed and he died. He was buried with ceremony in his tower, which was secured against thieves and fools. Those who learned the arts arcane from the Old Mage cast the most potent protective magics known upon his home and resting-place (which, many believe, remains inviolate today).~
@13193 = ~History of Waterdeep—Age IV, The Return of the Lords:

One day to the Courts of the Lord Magister came two people masked and robed as the Lords of Waterdeep of old. Where they came from no one knew, but they appeared in the Castle's Great Hall where the Courts were, and commanded the Lords Magister to leave the city forthwith. Laughing, the Lords Magister refused, whereupon the shorter of the masked intruders (the lady Shilam, apprentice to Ahghairon and his undeclared heir as first Lord of the City) blasted them with lightning and fire, and their very thrones were shattered and toppled.

The taller of the two intruders (Baeron) then called for the heads of the noble houses to come to them, or leave the city forthwith and forever, if they cared not to come by nightfall. All in the Courts heard, and the news was cried in the streets.

The surviving nobles came, reluctantly and with bodyguards, expecting such a summons to be a trap. Baeron spoke to them and the crowd of curious townsfolk that had also come, saying, "this must not happen again." If Waterdeep was to be safe once more, he told them, all must support what he and his fellow Lord now planned, as they had supported Ahghairon in the past. The two would choose others to be Lords as before, he said, and they would rule in secret, as before—save for himself. He removed his mask, and said, "I am Baeron. I would be Lord as Ahghairon was before. I would be safe in this my city again." And the folk of Waterdeep there agreed. Shilarn, still masked, commanded that the houses of the Two Lords Magister be Outcast. There was protest, and she raised her hands that had blasted the thrones, and it was still again. And the house of Gildeggh and of Zoar were outcast.

Peace returned to the city, and Waterdhavians to their labors. To inhibit discovery of who the Lords were, Baeron selected certain men of character whom he knew well, and appointed them Magisters ("Black Robes," they were soon called, from their robes of office) under the Lords, to judge and apply the laws of Waterdeep in daily affairs. These Magisters he paid well, to raise them from temptation, and gave lodgings to those who feared for safety to dwell among the people. To so serve, he told the city, was a burden, not a proud misuse of authority, and if any wished to no longer serve, or were found wanting, they were not to be vilified, but accorded respect. And over the Magisters the Lords sat in their Court, to correct and overrule the judgments of the Magisters. Baeron told the people that none were to decry or belittle any judgments of Magisters that the Lord saw fit to alter or cast aside. If any thought ill of the offices or those who held them they could turn back to the rule of sword and whim, and perish as had those before them. Before the Lord's Court Baeron encouraged people to speak freely for the length of a short candle's burning, without fear of chastisement or reproach from the Lords for anything said, as long as they spoke openly and answered questions or opposing views put to them by any there. Thus, he held, just grievances of folk would be heard, no matter how small the matter or lowly the speaker. And so it was. Slow to take hold, until people knew it for careful justice, but enduring beyond Baeron's time, and beyond Shilarn's time, and beyond the time of their daughter Lhestyn "The Masked Lady," who wed Zelphar Arunsun of Neverwinter, and was mother to Khelben "Blackstaff' Arunsun, a Lord of Waterdeep today, who knows the secrets of long years as Ahghairon did. And as the years have passed, Waterdeep has grown in size and variety, flourishing with good trade under the tolerance and protection of strong defenders and good government. The years passed not without troubles, varying from the Godswar (when Waterdeep played host to gods dying and ascending) to such occurrences as a green dragon assailing the Field of Triumph (part of a plot by the Knights of the Shield to overthrow the Lords' Rule), but the city and her peoples survived and prevailed against all strife. The Lords' Alliance provides continued safety for all the settlements of the northern Sword Coast and those inland, with Waterdeep as the heart of the alliance. Though it can be matched in size or commerce, there is no city the realms over that compares to the sheer variety of life and experiences found in fair Waterdeep, Crown of the North.~

The pool churns and swirls. Strange lights dance within. As you stare at the pool you catch a glimpse of a cityscape. For a brief moment, with absolute clarity, you watch as the city changes. Ages pass and the inhabitants drop their primitive tools and ways. Discoveries are made and the minds of the people change and grow, everyday grasping a new fact or invention. The image slips away until you see only a pool.~

Again, the pool clears. Life within the seas becomes a savage fight for survival. A creature seeks safety on land. It is merely the first. These pioneers grow and change, from giant lizards to tiny insects, they change, and the world with them. Heat and ice change places and eventually, a stooped, hairy, beast begins to walk on two legs so that his other appendages can be put to better use. The vision is lost to you.~

The churning pool clears for a moment. You see a man walk by, filthy and primitive. From a pouch of uncured skin of some nameless animal, he pulls a stick, held taut and bowed with a piece of dried sinew. He wraps the sinew about another stick and runs it from side to side, spinning the stick through a pile of tinder. Wisps of smoke rise and the man blows carefully. Soon he has a merry blaze. He grins, displaying a row of rotted and missing teeth. With the fire, he shall harden a spear. With the spear, he shall kill his brother. With his brother dead, he shall have a cave and a wife. The grin widens as the vision slowly fades. The pool is again still.~

There are those who find pride and glory in the chase, traveling above and underground to ensure the good fortune of our home, but I am not one of them. I must admit, I too would take up the arms should my name be called to protect those around me, but until that day, I feel myself far more resourceful creating the weapons than wielding them.

In honor of our new marvel, I have created a special blade that I will place with the other items commissioned for the monument receptacle. Should the day come the our way of life is defended by a sole survivor, he will fight with the will of many knowing that I have provided him with weapon worthy of such an honor. May this blade never be wielded, and if one day it is, may it serve its owner well.~

The door to the outside passage is locked, and I know the key rests within in a container built into the side of the forge monument. With some stroke of luck or higher intervention, I was able to avoid the attention of that dreadful lich on my last trip across, but upon inspection of the forge I was able to locate the receptacle. It seems likely that the monument will need to be restored to its original working state before the container's whereabouts could be determined, but I have been unable to locate anything remotely resembling a switch, lever or the like that would activate it. I can only assume that the lich is responsible, and as long as he is present within these chambers I will be unable to find the key, and unable to escape. I have found powerful magics within these tombs, but even if by some amazing stroke of luck I was able to dispatch the foul creature, he has undoubtedly hidden his life force container beyond these walls. Without its destruction, his absence from this world is purely temporary, and upon returning I do not dare dwell on the horrible fate that would be stalking me.~

The humans, the elves... only they are capable of such character, only they are able to bend when those around them needed them the most, only they. I cannot face my people now, for I am a changed man, and I will not return to accept that of which I am undeserving. Please forgive me.~

In the latter case, the blade is known to take up forty inches of the total length. Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip. Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting. The blade of this sword is covered with all sorts of arcane symbols.

@14562 = ~The last few weeks have been a blur, but I will recount as best as I can.

Arriving at Dorn's Deep in the middle of the night did not lead to a warm welcome by the dwarves, especially with what had come to pass between both our races. As expected, the dwarves were very apprehensive of what I had to say. There were too many fresh and open wounds between both our peoples. Situations like this are never easy, but I consider myself as good a diplomat as Father, perhaps better.

Each day spent in council did not end until late evening, and always in pure exhaustion. We argued and bickered over the recent past events. Although we still continued to spend countless hours in council, the dwarves began to trust that I hid no maliciousness behind my words. The dwarves agreed to a treaty in the name of the greater good for both our races later that week. I had been successful in my part. I saw hope for the first time in many months.

The only thing left was to return home and convince my own people that this was our only chance at true salvation. The hardest part would be to convince Father, but he will listen. He must listen; else let our people face death.

The next morning almost made the last few weeks' work in vain. A dwarven scout arrived and told us the largest orcish army he had ever seen was only hours away. With little time to prepare, our defenses were overrun and the orcs began to pour into Dorn's Deep.

We began our retreat into the depths of Dorn's Deep. Key passages were collapsed to cover our movements and buy us time. Even in such dire conditions, this allowed the dwarves to control when and where we would fight. Every battle cost the orcs dearly, as the dwarves fought on their terms, but we were still being driven farther and farther back. Even now, we make preparations to retreat farther into Wyrm's Tooth Glacier.

Even as grim as this sounds, I still hold hope. Hope that I will tell Father of how I fought side by side with our dwarven friends as in days of old. Hope that he will hear the tales of the dwarves who sacrificed their lives so that I may return home someday to reunite both our peoples. Hope to see my father's stubborn face once again.

For my people and the Seldarine's Hand,

Unicorns are herbivores, living on tender leaves and grasses. Their only enemies are griffons and those creatures that destroy forests, in particular red dragons and orcs.

The life span of unicorns has never been recorded but is known to surpass 1,000 years. They are believed to maintain their youth until death is only weeks away. The secret to this longevity is the strong magical nature of the horn. Unicorn horns are maliciously sought after since possession of one is a sovereign remedy against all poisons.~

Stationed atop Shevarash Tower are the proud hippogriffs of the Seldarine's Hand. Along with their riders, these mounts serve primarily as scouts but are sometimes used for missions requiring the utmost of speed.

Both rider and mount are trained rigorously to work as a team. Upon hatching, hippogriffs are domesticated to be used as mounts. They are trained in what to eat, various combat routines involving aerial and ground attacks, and to respond to the commands of its rider. The riders are educated in the ways of grooming and caring for its mount, how to work effectively with his hippogriff, and also in the ways of aerial and ground combat.

As a unit, they have proven excellent aerial support in our ground battles and are a proud symbol of the Seldarine.~

Pelham eventually enchanted Owain's Lullabye for the bard in exchange for a small sum of money. Owain rarely used the instrument in battle, typically employing it when he found late-migrating geese lounging on a lake. He would blow the horn in such a way that the geese heard it as the sound of their cousins heading south for the winter. As the geese would attempt to take flight, Owain's horn would freeze them in mid-stroke, where he would leave them to die.

It is an imposing fortress, kept in strict isolation from the intrigues that occasionally plague the rest of the realms. It is secluded, highly regimented, and it is home.~ [INTRO01F]
@15880 = ~Within these hallowed halls of knowledge your story begins. You have spent most of your 20 years of life within this keep's austere walls, under the tutelage of the sage Gorion. Acting as your father, he has raised you on a thousand tales of heroes and monsters, lovers and infidels, battles and tragedies. However, one story was always left untold: that of your true heritage. You have been told that you are an orphan, but your past is largely unknown.~ [INTRO02F]
@15881 = ~Drawn to the clamor of the forge at an early age, you have become quite skilled working for the monks of the keep, and have kept them supplied with whatever tools are occasionally required. Inspired by your foster father's tales of ironclad heroes, however, you know you would much rather swing a blade than a smithy's hammer. One of the Watchers has been kind enough to take you under her wing, and has trained you in the basics of the deadly arts. You yearn to leave the safe walls of your library home and venture forth along the Trade Way, a trusty weapon at your side.~
@15882 = ~Inspired by your foster father's knowledge of the magical arts, you have made especially productive use of your library home. You have poured over the vast, if often inaccessible, treasury of magical lore, and learnt as much as you can. Gorion has been kind enough to instruct you in the basics, but he seems a touch overly concerned about your safety. You know, however, that experience could teach you so much more, and you yearn to travel as a journeyman mage.~
@15883 = ~Inspired by your foster father's colorful tales of rogues and scoundrels, you have spent your childhood yearning for intrigue. On the stage of your imagination, the ambling, preoccupied monks of the keep have often played the secret lords of Waterdeep, their purses ripe targets for your nimble fingers. On more than one occasion Gorion has asked you to very tactfully return a pen or an inkwell to the pocket from which it came. The more valuable of the keep's treasures remain impenetrable to your wiles, but you have little desire to steal from your benefactors anyway; you long for more appropriate and accessible pickings.	~
@15884 = ~Long have you marveled at the tales read to you by your foster father, many gathered from the various holy books on the shelves of Candlekeep. The strength and power of faith inspired you, but the petty squabbles of the gods only filled you with disdain. From this you came to understand the monks with whom you share your home, and the nature of their nondenominational beliefs. Joining in their studies you have come to think of yourself as one of the Avowed. Some of the brethren, perhaps responding to Gorion's subtle urging, have graciously fielded your many questions and taught you much about the meaning and role of the priesthood.~
@15885 = ~Set as they were against the sounds of the sea crashing against the rocks outside the keep, you have always been drawn to your foster father's tales of the unspoiled wilderness. You have occasionally found exotic flowers pressed and long forgotten between the pages of tomes, and often spent long hours studying Nature's varied forms in some of the library's many journals. It is your foremost wish that someday you will leave the sterile walls of Candlekeep, and worship the Earthmother in her own presence.~
@15886 = ~You have long been enraptured by your foster father's countless tales, though not so much for the content as for the art of the telling. Blessed by a world of books, you have surrounded yourself with the ancient legends and endless lore, and developed quite a skill for showmanship. One of the cooks has become quite fond of you and, between recitations of often bawdy poems and songs, has provided you with somewhat haphazard voice instruction. Gorion, in his kindness and wisdom, has been urging you to find another teacher before you ruin your voice for good.~
@15887 = ~Inspired by your foster father's tales of chivalry and honor, from a young age you committed yourself to the pursuit of good and the punishment of evil. Candlekeep is a world of many sacred and unspoken laws, and you have learned to uphold them all unquestionably. Your honesty and integrity have brought you to the attention of some of the keep's Great Readers, but as of yet none of them have had cause to call upon your services. While the citadel sees the passage of the occasional ne'er-do-well, its regimented atmosphere rarely needs to be purged of evil. The peace of your surroundings should be comforting, but instead you find it stifling. You know your true place is traveling the realms, fighting evil wherever the need arises.~
@15888 = ~Inspired by your foster father's tales of adventure amidst the barrens, hills, and forests of Faerûn, you have learned to appreciate the power and challenges of the wilderness. While you cannot remember ever venturing further than the outer walls of Candlekeep, you are a welcome and frequent visitor to its stables and pens. Much of your time is also spent atop the great towers of the citadel, where birds often seek shelter from both predators and the chill of the ocean winds. Still, you yearn to reach beyond, deep into the meadows and forests that you behold from your lofty perch.~
@15889 = ~Inspired by your foster father's loving tales, you have always dreamt of living the life of an adventurer, traveling the land by your wits and talents alone. The grounds of the keep were often the stage for many an imagined battle, much to the consternation of the monks that share your home. Companions your age being somewhat of a rarity, you endured by playing every role yourself, a habit that has stayed with you as you enter into adulthood. As Gorion used to advise you, "A little bit of everything makes a better soup."~
@15890 = ~You know little of how you came to be a ward of Gorion's, but over the years you have gleaned something of your mother's tale from his vague allusions and from the words he sometimes uttered in tear-filled sleep. She was a dwarf from Mithral Hall and a friend of his for many seasons. As you have no memory of her, nor any keepsakes to remind you of her existence, you have come to believe that she died while giving birth to you. Perhaps it was the pain of such a parting that led Gorion to cloister himself within the narrow halls of Candlekeep and raise you as his own. Of your father, you have learned nothing.~

@15986 = ~You cannot further specialize in this proficiency.~
@15987 = ~Playing! Mother said to wait here until she comes back.~
@15988 = ~Carrion Crawler
The carrion crawler is a scavenger of subterranean areas, feeding primarily upon carrion. However, when such food becomes scarce or when it is threatened, it will attack and kill living creatures.

The carrion crawler looks like a cross between a giant green cutworm and a cephalopod. Like so many other hybrid monsters, the carrion crawler may well be the result of genetic experimentation by a mad, evil wizard. 

The monster's head is covered with a tough hide, but the body is not well protected. The monster is accompanied by a rank, fetid odor which often gives warning of its approach.~
@15989 = ~Who is your mother?~
@15990 = ~Ettercap
Ettercaps are ugly bipedal creatures that get along very well with all types of giant spiders. These creatures of low intelligence are exceedingly cruel, very cunning, and are skilled in setting traps—very deadly traps—much like the spiders that often live around them.

Ettercaps stand around six feet tall, even with their stooping gait and hunched shoulders. The creatures have short, spindly legs, long arms that reach nearly to their ankles, and large pot-bellies. The hands of ettercaps have a thumb and three long fingers that end in razor sharp claws. Their bodies are covered by tufts of thick, wiry, black hair, and their skin is dark and thick. Ettercaps' heads are almost equine in shape, but they have large reptilian eyes, usually blood-red in color, and large fangs, one protruding downward from each side of the mouth. The mouth itself is large and lined with very sharp teeth.

Ettercaps do not have a formal language. They express themselves through a combination of high-pitched chittering noises, shrieks and violent actions.~
@15991 = ~Ghoul
Ghouls are undead creatures, once human, who now feed on the flesh of corpses. Although the change from human to ghoul has deranged and destroyed their minds, ghouls have a terrible cunning which enables them to hunt their prey most effectively.

Ghouls are vaguely recognizable as once having been human, but have become horribly disfigured by their change to ghouls. The tongue becomes long and tough for licking marrow from cracked bones, the teeth become sharp and elongated, and the nails grow strong and sharp like claws.~
@15992 = ~It was nice meeting you, Sehriya. Farewell.~
@15993 = ~...~
@15994 = ~Gibberling 
They come screaming, jabbering, and howling out of the night. Dozens, maybe hundreds, of hunchbacked, naked humanoids swarm unceasingly forward. They have no thought of safety, subtlety, or strategy, leaving others with no hope of stopping their mass assault. Then, having come and killed, the gibberlings move on, seemingly randomly, back into the night.

The first impression of gibberlings is of a writhing mass of fur and flesh in the distant moonlit darkness. The pandemonium is actually a mass of pale, hunchbacked humanoids, with pointed canine ears and black manes surrounding their hideous, grinning faces. Their black eyes shine with a maniacal gleam.~
@15995 = ~Gnoll
Gnolls are large, evil, hyena-like humanoids that roam about in loosely organized bands.

While the body of a gnoll is shaped like that of a large human, the details are those of a hyena. They stand erect on two legs and have hands that can manipulate as well as those of any human. They have greenish gray skin, darker near the muzzle, with a short reddish gray to dull yellow mane.~
@15996 = ~Hobgoblin
Hobgoblins are a fierce humanoid race that wage perpetual war with the other humanoid races. They are intelligent, organized, and aggressive. 

The typical hobgoblin is a burly humanoid standing at least six feet tall. Their hairy hides range from dark reddish-brown to dark gray. Their faces show dark red or red-orange skin. Large males have blue or red noses. Hobgoblin eyes are either yellowish or dark brown while their teeth are yellow. Their garments tend to be brightly colored, often bold, blood red. Any leather is always tinted black. Hobgoblin weaponry is kept polished and repaired.

Hobgoblins have their own language and often speak with orcs, goblins, and carnivorous apes.~
@15997 = ~Kobold 
Kobolds are a cowardly, sadistic race of short humanoids that vigorously contest the human and demihuman races for living space and food. They especially dislike gnomes and attack them on sight.

Barely clearing three feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a pair of bright red sparks, and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white. Because of the kobold fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity.~
@15998 = ~Ogre
Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft. Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of orc tribes, evil clerics, or gnolls. They mingle freely with giants and trolls.

Adult ogres stand nine to ten feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often of a different color—or at least darker than their hides. Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish blue to dull dark green. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably well.

It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is 90 years.~
@15999 = ~Skeleton
All skeletons are magically animated undead monsters, created as guardians or warriors by powerful evil wizards and priests.

Skeletons appear to have no ligaments or musculature which would allow movement. Instead, the bones are magically joined together during the casting of an Animate Dead spell. Skeletons have no eyes or internal organs.

Skeletons can be made from the bones of humans and demihumans, animals of human size or smaller, or giant humanoids like bugbears and giants.~
@16000 = ~Giant Spider
Spiders are aggressive predators, dwelling both above and below ground. Most are poisonous and bite prey before devouring them because unconscious victims are easier to carry to a lair.

Spiders have eight legs and eight eyes. They usually fit into two categories: web-spinners, which have bulbous abdomens and thin, sleek legs; and hunting spiders, which have smaller bodies, larger heads and fangs, and hairy bodies and legs.

Most giant spiders are simply much bigger versions of the web-spinning large spiders.~

The high priest of Labelas typically wore the girdle in day-to-day activities as well as battle. Made of alternating bands of bronze and gold, the fine belt was a prize even without its magical properties. When orcs sacked Myth Glaurach, this girdle was one of the most prominent items stolen.

Thieves access their skills using the icons along the bottom of their screen. "Thieving" includes Pick Lock, Pick Pocket, and Remove Trap, when used in conjunction with the appropriate targets (chests, people, and traps, respectively). "Find Traps" examines a general area, and outlines found traps in red. "Stealth" renders a thief effectively invisible until their next attack. That attack is automatically a "backstab," increasing the damage of a successful hit dramatically.

@16230 = ~My friend Gorion,

Please forgive the abruptness with which I now write, but time is short and there is much to be done. What we have long feared may soon come to pass, though not in the manner foretold, and certainly not in the proper time frame. As we both know, forecasting these events has proved increasingly difficult, leaving little option other than a leap of faith. We have done what we can for those in thy care, but the time nears when we must step back and let matters take what course they will. We have, perhaps, been a touch too sheltering to this point. 

Despite my desire to remain neutral in this matter, I could not, in good conscience, let events proceed without some measure of warning. The other side will move very soon, and I urge thee to leave Candlekeep this very night, if possible. The darkness may seem equally threatening, but a moving target is much harder to hit, regardless of how sparse the cover. A fighting chance is all that can be asked for at this point

Should anything go awry, do not hesitate to seek aid from travelers along the way. I do not need to remind thee that it is a dangerous land, even without our current concerns, and a party is stronger than an individual in all respects. Should additional assistance be required, I understand that Jaheira and Khalid are currently at the Friendly Arm Inn. They know little of what has passed, but they are ever thy friends and will no doubt help however they can.

Luck be with us all.
I'm getting too old for this.

@16782 = ~Viol of the Hollow Men~
@16783 = ~This instrument is also known as "Tallow's Violin," but that moniker is rarely spoken among musicians, as mentioning the name of Nikolai Tallow is considered bad luck. Nikolai was born in the Vast, near High Haspur, the son of a chandler. Because of the intermittent traffic through the region, Nikolai was introduced to many different cultures. One of the travelers he met was an elven musician named Relev Thinriver. Relev introduced Nikolai to the violin and taught him for several years as he wandered through the area. Relev knew that Nikolai was an incredibly gifted child, with quick fingers, a keen mind, and a passion for all things in the world. Relev also recognized that Nikolai was exceedingly proud and arrogant. In spite of Nikolai's shortcomings, Relev taught him everything he knew.

After Relev was killed by a band of orcs, Nikolai began to practice on his own throughout the Vast. Despite his travels, he always returned to the isolated peaks of his mountain birthplace. He became famed throughout the Vast, the southern Moonsea, and Sembia for his incredible talent and passionate performances. Eventually, news of the proud young virtuoso spread to the ears of a nearby thug from Calaunt named Tremble Ghon. When Tremble and his gang traveled through the Elvenblood Pass, they stopped at the Elf in Armor Inn and demanded a performance from Nikolai, who happened to be present and eating dinner with his father at the time.

Nikolai refused to perform for Tremble and his men. He called them stinking oafs and attempted to leave with dignity. Tremble assaulted Nikolai's pride by claiming that Nikolai was afraid of performing because he'd be heckled out of the inn for his incompetence. Nikolai shot back that his skill with the violin was so great that he could raise the dead from their graves. Satisfied with a proposed challenge, Tremble immediately grabbed Nikolai's father and stabbed him in the heart. When a number of other villagers attempted to intervene, they were also killed by the bandits.

Tremble defiantly stood over Nikolai's dead father and said, "Where's your big mouth now, fiddle player?" Without a word, Nikolai pulled his violin and bow out from underneath his arms and began to play a melody that none of the residents of High Haspur had ever heard before and no one in Faerûn would ever hear again. Nikolai played with unbridled passion and fervor. Onlookers later remarked that he appeared to be a madman, thrashing about in ways that people didn't think were possible. At the climax of his frenzied piece, Tremble and his gang watched in horror as the souls of the men and women they had just killed rose from their corpses and dove, shrieking, at their murderers. The bandits died horrible deaths, chilled by the shadows of their victims. Nikolai himself continued playing, dancing through the streets and back pastures of his alpine home until every man, woman, child, and beast ever buried in the region rose from its resting place and milled about until Nikolai and his music disappeared into a far-off valley, shrouded in a mysterious fog that vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

Legends say that on misty nights, the ghost of Nikolai Tallow returns to his homeland, playing a phantom violin with a host of dancing dead trailing behind him in the moonlight.

It was constructed by a group of well-intentioned halflings when Illian hunted down and killed a priest of Malar and his bloodthirsty trained animals, who had been plaguing the halfling shire. The helm served Illian well until he went hunting a great stag on Cinnaelos'Cor, an elven holiday. When the stag leapt into a thick patch of vines and briars, Illian followed. As Illian leapt through the tangle, the huge horns of the helm became caught, jerking his head violently. He was found dead the next day with a broken neck.

@16976 = ~This helm was worn by the dwarven warrior Danel Silverfrost, king and martyr of the lost dwarven city-state of Silverrock. Danel's deeds are not as well known as those of many other heroic dwarves, but that is perhaps because his kingdom died with him. His nation suffered heavy losses when trolls and giants attacked it over a thousand years ago in the nearly forgotten "War of Curdling Blood." The war between the tribes of monsters and the kingdom of Silverrock was waged over fifteen years. Danel never attempted to flee his kingdom, seek the aid of neighboring countries, or abandon his people. Despite the fact that many of his subjects did indeed flee, Danel remained in Silverrock until the very end. Before the final battle of the terrible war, Danel told his people, "When ye see this plume on me head fall, I want ye to make sure that our people don't bow, like gold, but that they break, like iron." 

Almost as soon as the battle was joined, Danel charged to the front of the fray and leapt into the talons of a dozen trolls. The moment his plume disappeared from sight, every man, woman, and child remaining in Silverrock poured out of the fortified caverns and dragged down as many trolls and giants as they could. Barrels of flaming oil were dumped all over Danel's palace and the common areas of the city, consuming as many dwarves as trolls and terrible frost giants. In the end, the monsters had achieved a Pyrrhic victory. The dwarven city was a smoldering ruin from which little treasure, no slaves, and no food could be taken. Many trolls died of starvation that winter, and when they turned on their giant allies for sustenance, the entire army fell into disarray forever.

@17276 = ~The Golden Pantaloons did surely see the very beginnings of our realm; though I must press that they "saw" this formative time by their simple presence, and not through some vestigial eyes that might have erupted through a rear pocket perhaps concealing teeth and other improbable extremities. I am sure that the various owners of the pantaloons can attest to the general lack of animated digits or ocular sensors, as evidenced by the continued sanctity and privacy maintained by their respective buttocks.

Lyric pantoums of an age long since out of print speak of "trousers that were as metal, though soft about the shanks." While it might be easy to jump to the seemingly inevitable conclusion that the trousers rose while Netheril fell, it is doubtful that the pantaloons were the garments of which they speak. One must clarify these oft-misquoted verses with knowledge of the Pantechnicon, an ancient bazaar once prized for Silver Pantalets. Fine these may have been, but golden they were not. Nickel Panties are also said to be currently available, though the dockside establishments that claim to offer these products are beyond my meager experience, and thus I can make no report.

The purpose of the Pantaloons is as mysterious as ever, and will likely remain so until the Pantocrator himself returns, though some properties can be divined though intimate observation. The "uplifting" properties of the gusset very nearly defy gravity, shaping quite nicely both the front and rear. This improved contour would likely increase self-esteem for a wearer of either sex. I would hazard a guess, however, that this continuing self delusion might actually hamper cognitive functions, and care should be taken in the wearing of any pantaloons of golden nature.~

Once the victim would try on the girdle, Valom would kick them over the side of the boat, where they would quickly drown. Valom's luck ran out when he kicked Herred of Procampur into the Sea of Fallen Stars. Herred had a potion of water breathing and a helm of underwater action with him at the time. When the huge, seaweed-covered form of Herred emerged near the docks where Valom was resting, a local priest of Tyr immediately came to his aid. Upon discovering what Valom had done, the priest of Tyr and three paladins attempted to capture him. Valom killed two of the paladins, but died in the battle. It is believed that the belt was later sold to a traveling collector who specialized in cursed clothing.

The subject is to be considered a formidable foe, and is likely to have well-equipped traveling companions.

@17924 = ~Named for its ability to lay warriors low, the Cairn Blade was used by the mercenary Adal Kerrn. Kerrn was a skilled heavy infantryman. He and his company, Kerrn's Breakers, hired themselves out to all sorts of warlords, bandits, wizards, and religious leaders. They were typically placed at the front of the battlefield, where they would intercept charging heavy cavalry units and break their formation. Kerrn died in 1054 DR when he accidentally killed the horse of a heavily armored foe. The horse fell on top of Kerrn, killing him. In the madness of the battle that followed, most of his comrades were routed. Though Kerrn's body was never found, the group that had employed him at the time, the church of Helm, recovered his distinctive sword.

Power Word, Kill is perhaps the deadliest word of power. It kills up to two enemies with 31 to 60 Hit Points or a group of enemies with 30 or fewer Hit Points, up to a maximum of 120 Hit Points. The Hit Point checks are done against a creature's current Hit Points, not their maximum, so it will affect extremely tough creatures that have been wounded.~

If you defeat Terikan's physical form, make haste for the Hall of Heroes, for he will only be subdued for a short while.~
@18442 = ~I'll see what I can do. Let me ask you another question.~
@18443 = ~Thank you for the information. I'll be on my way now.~
@18444 = ~Two catastrophes occurred within Dorn's Deep. The first was the destruction of our community at the hands of the orcs. More recently, there has been the occupation of our cemetery, the Tiers of the Dead, by the necromancer Terikan.~
@18445 = ~Tell me about the destruction of your community.~
@18446 = ~~
@18447 = ~~
@18448 = ~~
@18449 = ~Throughout the history of Dorn's, we've always had to contend with the orc hordes that threatened our way of life. However, thanks to inspired diplomacy between the leaders of our community and the elves of the Severed Hand, we forged an alliance that kept both of our homes safe from harm.~
@18450 = ~What happened?~
@18451 = ~I am not certain, but it was apparent, at least from our perspective, that someone was deliberately attempting to seed mistrust between the dwarven and elven communities. When the orcs began appearing far better equipped than in times previous, the elves began to suspect that dwarven smithies were in league with the horde.~
@18452 = ~Why would they think you'd supply your enemies with weapons?~
@18453 = ~Not any dwarf within Dorn's Deep, I can tell you that much. We were warriors, not betrayers. If truth be told, I believe both communities were deceived by someone within one of our own families. I know not who, but I hope that when that person meets their end they feel the pain of every dwarf and elf that lost their lives.~
@18454 = ~~
@18455 = ~I am known as Norlinor. While alive, I served as a priest of Moradin for our church here within Dorn's Deep. Specifically, I was given the title Artisan of the Forge, and it was my duty to maintain this place. I died defending this temple... I did not anticipate revisiting it in the afterlife.~
@18456 = ~Why are you here now?~
@18457 = ~~

@18459 = ~The presence of Terikan, the necromancer who has taken up residence in the Tiers of the Dead, has quenched the flames that gave the forge life. With the forge cold, the spirits of the dead have become restless, forced from their tombs into servitude for that monster. Almost all the dead of Dorn's Deep are now enslaved to Terikan... I fear I am the only one who remains free.~

@18461 = ~~
@18462 = ~~
@18463 = ~Terikan's transformation into a lich has caused enough negative energy to be drawn to the area that even our forges and machines have been affected.

@18483 = ~Fine.~
@18484 = ~From one vile caretaker to another. You have helped my brothers and me, defiler, but I know it was of no inclination of yours to do so. I assume you have some plundering to do, so I'll leave you to your trade.~
@18485 = ~Leave then—your preaching *was* growing tiresome.~
@18486 = ~Terikan knew no mortal man could ever master the vortice. Shortly after his arrival in our home, he began preparing himself for the rituals necessary to become a lich. Fortunately, Terikan must have neglected some of the proper enchantments, as the powers he wields are inferior to much of his kind.~
@18487 = ~If so, can you stop him?~
@18488 = ~That is where fortune favors us. The very vortice that Terikan is studying can destroy him as well. It lies within the Hall of Heroes, inside the tomb of Jamoth. Any undead being, regardless of power, is pulled back to that dreadful plane of existence upon entry into the tomb. That is why I have never been able to enter the tomb myself.~

Your former home looms before you, but the gate is closed and barred. Over the walls there is a candle in your old room, but as the light goes out, the brick surrounding the window closes together. The very walls conspire to keep you at bay. 

A familiar voice startles you, though it is calm and caring. "You cannot go back this way, child. You must go on." Gorion forms before you, and though his image should be comforting, it seems but a shade of his living self. He is dead in your dreams, as in life. 

The phantom of your foster father gestures towards the blackness of the wood as though it should be inviting. Perhaps it is, in a way, but the traveling will be hard. As you think this, a smooth and obvious path becomes clear out the corner of your eye. It seems meant for you, pulls at your very being, and promises to quickly lead you away from the life you once led. Perhaps this would be for the best, but it is a bit too convenient for your liking. You do not wish to dwell upon the loss you have endured, but neither should it be forgotten. Gorion smiles, and fades away. 

The pull becomes a push, but you turn away, steadfast in your new direction. The way is not quite as clear, but it is sure to be interesting nonetheless. A whisper follows as you stride away, something vestigial and sinister that you recognize, but yet have never heard. "You will learn..." 

You don't look back.~ [DREAM1G]
@19268 = ~You do not dream often, but tonight the visions are vivid indeed. Long have you walked, but now you find yourself back amidst the stones of Candlekeep. Your former home looms before you, the drab walls just as you remember them. Over the barricades you can see your old room, and you wonder if it really was as small as it appears now. 

As you stand before the keep, a familiar figure comes into view. Gorion stands before you, but his visage is shadowy and weak. He is dead in your dreams, as in life. 

The phantom of your foster father mutely walks towards the woods, towards supposed safety, and beckons for you to follow as he did once before. This time you remain behind, knowing what is to come.

Before your eyes, phantoms of the past reenact the pathetic scene that must have taken place in your absence. Clad in armor assuredly magical, a figure strides from the darkness. Admittedly a powerful mage in his youth, Gorion is all but helpless before the onslaught. As he falls, the scene begins again, replaying over and over. Each successive viewing makes the unknown warrior all the more impressive. 

As you stare at the murderer of your former mentor, one thought coalesces in your mind: you will have such power as this. Whatever it takes, you will have all that he does, and more. With that, a passage becomes clear through the darkened wood, and you wonder how you could have missed it. The trees close behind you as you walk, but you are unconcerned. The path feels right, and will assuredly give you what you seek. It seems to promise this in a voice you know, but yet have never heard. 

The image of Gorion's death replays in your mind throughout the night.
 
You get used to it.~ [DREAM1E]
@19269 = ~You are startled out of sleep with a chill, though the night is warm and calm. It is as though someone has walked across your grave, and for a moment you wonder if it was you. With this thought the ground beneath you opens and you are swept into the dark.

When light returns, you do not find its presence comforting. Before you lay the empty mines of Nashkel, cleansed by your previous passage. You move through walls and floors alike, descending deeper and deeper, until a bloated figure comes into view. Mulahey, in no better shape than you left him, stands motionless before you. 

Held from whatever afterlife calls it, this foul apparition has been waiting for you. A dagger of bone hovers before it, ready for a willing hand to drive it deep. Had this creature breath you are sure it would be hurling curses. It waits for the kill, a death beyond death, and knows no hope. 

You turn your back on the blade, and it clatters to the floor. Punishment enough shall find this creature in the land of the dead; you need not inflict any more upon him. 

Surprised and thankful, the visage of Mulahey hobbles forward and through you, off to whatever fate it deserves. Perhaps for safekeeping, it leaves a part of itself behind. It is a spark of hope that fills a space within you; a dagger-shaped hole you did not know was empty. 

There is a cry of rage from the depths, and the dagger of bone launches itself though the air, your heart its target. You awake just as it should have struck, and the cold sweat that covers you stings your eyes. A disapproving voice lingers in your ears, though it should have disappeared with the dream. "You... WILL... Learn!"~ [DREAM2G]
@19270 = ~The stone tunnels of the Nashkel mines constrain your dreams tonight. The twisting depths are more a nuisance than claustrophobic now, what with the hidden marauders dead at your feet. Deeper you tread, chuckling over your triumph at each body you see, pausing occasionally to wipe your boots clean or check the odd kobold for coins you might have missed. 

There is a sound from below and you quickly move towards it. A door opens and before you stands Mulahey in no better shape than you left him. Held from whatever afterlife calls it, this specter has apparently been waiting for you. A dagger of bone hovers before it, ready for a willing hand to drive it deep. Had this creature breath you are sure it would be hurling curses. It waits for the kill, a death beyond death, and knows no hope. Rightfully so.

You brush aside the quaint blade and bring your hands around the creature's neck. A stranger's weapon simply will not suffice in this matter; you must be certain this phantom remains among the dead. It is strange though; doomed as he is, Mulahey still looks somewhat relieved. His visage fades within your grasp and leaves you clutching at empty air. A puzzling turn, but of little concern. The mine is yours once again. 

You turn to leave, but find the exit blocked. The lone dagger has become five: a skeletal set of claws that hovers before you. A talon extends and presses against your chest, and a hollow voice chills the air. "You should use the tools you are given." It traces a line of ichor on your tunic, increasing in pressure. "Listen to what is bred in the bone." There is a flash of motion as the claws push deep into your chest. 

You awake in an instant, the sound of morning a welcome clamor. You are intact and, though tired, you are certainly not afraid.

Your heart is not your weak spot.~ [DREAM2E]
@19271 = ~As darkness falls, your mind drifts back to events past, and to triumphs well deserved indeed. A fortified camp secluded and guarded from the entire coast, and it is naught but easy pickings before your guile. All manner of bandit and brigand move about here, but you may as well be invisible amongst them. 

Your recollections are interrupted by a powerful gust of wind, lifting you high above the camp and woods both. Your arc crests in the high morning sun, and for a moment you are as a bird, free from your duties to those below. With unseen hands the earth reasserts her hold on you, and suddenly you feel less like a sparrow and more like a catapult stone. 

Without impact or fanfare, the ground accepts your passage and does not strike back. In a moment all is black, and for all you know you have descended to the very core of the world. The rock around you illuminates and a cavern slowly takes shape, though you can see no more than a few steps ahead or behind. Stumbling forward you find yourself face to face with... yourself.

Your recollections are interrupted without impact or fanfare, as the earth opens to accept your passage. The cascading rock and gravel prevents your escape, and in a moment all is black. For all you know you have descended to the very core of the world. 

The walls around you illuminate and a cavern slowly takes shape, though you can see no more than a few steps ahead or behind. Stumbling forward you find yourself face to face with... yourself.

This blood seems a frightening thing: a massive force that sweeps away all resistance. As a whole it is a monster and it cannot be stopped. Were it to be viewed from on high, it would seem to cover the entire world in its red-black embrace. 

You, however, do not have such a lofty perch. From within the deluge you can see it does not move as one, but is filled with currents, eddies, and undertows. Pockets of calm afford breathing space, whilst violent whirlpools threaten to rend limb from limb. Ultimately it seems undirected, and lacks a driving will, a quality you have in abundance. You may be caught within, but sufficient determination can shape what you need to survive. There are still options open; still choices to be made. 

As the tide presses forward you steer as you wish, atop a ship called Persistence and under sails made of resolve. 

A sudden and deliberate wave puts an end to your course, and to the dream. It would seem that the flood does have some will, and took offence to your enjoying the ride.~ [DREAM4G]

@19276 = ~You close your eyes tonight, and visions of Candlekeep swim into view. As you pass through the gates of the citadel there is a flash of memory, and you are a child of only a few seasons once more. At your side is Gorion, gray-haired even all those years ago. How old must he have been to age so little in the time since? 

Aged as he ever was, you still have to run to keep up with him. He has an important meeting with Ulraunt, the Keeper of the Tomes: an important meeting about you. Funny, you don't remember it.

As you stand outside the doors of the inner keep you can hear the shouting from within. Gorion seldom raised his voice, though you did not care to listen to the "discussions" at your previous stops either.
  
As you trace patterns in the water of a fountain, a reflection distracts you from the argument. A large raven has perched atop a stone wall, and stares directly at you with huge black eyes. You stare back through the mirror of the water, and are suddenly afraid to meet the bird's gaze any other way. It has claws for feet you think to yourself: little skeletal claws. 

The doors of the keep suddenly swing open and Ulraunt storms out. He glances at you for a moment, but looks away as he speaks. "You both can stay," he sneers, "but mark my words. That child will be the death of you." 

A flash of memory once more, and Gorion walks out of the keep as he is today: dead. You drop your gaze back to the water so as not to see. The raven is gone, but your own image remains. Your eyes are black, like those of a bird.

Tonight you are the monster everyone claims you are; the kobold scorned like a rodent; the ogre that children fear comes in the night. The mobs and their torches now come for you, counting you among the creatures you once did hunt. Or so someone would have you believe.

Once again you hear the voice; a voice that now makes no secret of its origins. It speaks of destiny and nature, and of evils bred in the bone. It says you will never be free of the mob; that they will hunt you for what you are. Murder and death run through your heart and accepting that will supposedly give you power. The essence of Bhaal within you cannot be ignored.

But you have not ignored it. You realize that from the first you have fought the very blood in your veins, fought dagger and claw for each victory, and ultimately you have triumphed. With righteous will, you have turned the dark forces within you to good purpose. Whatever the foundation of your being, you have remade yourself in your own image. 

Amidst threats it does not yet know are empty, the voice tries to play upon your doubts, but finds none. As you stare unwavering, the presence grows weaker and weaker. As it fades from your mind, one warning does stand out amidst the din. It speaks of others that will listen where you have not, others that will embrace what you have rejected, and others that will be your death. This describes but one man, and you know of no other it could be. He who orchestrated your fall, deceived your comrades, and deserves all that your justice shall mete upon him. Sarevok.

It is mistaken. You have already accepted what runs in your veins: you have accepted it and moved on. Whatever the foundation of the blood within you, it is yours and no one else's. If there is power to be had, then you will administer it as you see fit, and not according to the ravings of a shade long dead. 

You calmly turn your back and walk away, applying the most powerful weapon you have at your disposal: indifference. Let the dead rattle on if they wish. Had they the power to harm you they would have done so a dozen times over. More tangible threats require attention.
  
The voice becomes shrill and piercing as you walk, but gradually grows weaker. As it fades, one warning does stand out amidst the din.

His treachery will affect the Sword Coast for some time to come, but the region will eventually return to what it calls "normal." 

There has been a more permanent effect upon you, however. 

You and Sarevok shared more than you would care to know. You were of the same blood, the same lineage, and the poison that ran through his heart has the potential to take yours as well. You have heard the whispers of the past, as your sibling must have, but you chose to shut them out. While it is hard to imagine the towering Sarevok as weak, despite his menacing nature he succumbed to the dark temptations that you have not. 

The whispers may yet become screams, however, and there is danger that remains real. For you, and the rest of the realms alike.

Would Sarevok have become a god if his plans had reached fruition? It is unlikely. At least, not in the manner he would have wished. Sarevok caused great suffering in the name of his father, but somehow you know that his untimely death has perhaps served the dead god more. As you watched the essence of your sibling drain away, a horrible scenario emerged in your mind. This child; raised to madness, driven to conquest, ultimately killed by those that would righteously oppose him; his entire life was nothing more than "fuel" for the eventual rebirth of the father. Bhaal seeded the world with offspring to effect his resurrection, not his replacement. 

Certainly an appropriate way to return power to a dead Lord of Murder.~

@19328 = ~A wicked-looking dagger with a dark history, the Salamander's Tongue is prized both for its use as a weapon and its hidden magical powers. The blade appears to be an exotic-looking dagger with a kris-like wavy blade ending in two small points. A small portion of a slimy, bright-red living salamander's tongue is somehow embedded in the heart of the blade, near the grip. It pulses and writhes randomly without intervention from the owner. 

The exact origins of the blade are unknown, but it is believed that the first owner of the weapon was a respected and feared gnomish thief and assassin from Westgate named Turlam Shallowhill. Turlam was killed in a fight with a rival, a halfling called Deder Seven Fingers. Deder kept the weapon as a trophy, not knowing its powers until after it was stolen by an underling, a fellow halfling named Kreshinal Blackhound. Kreshinal fled to Selgaunt with the dagger for five years, relying on its powers to hide him from divination. Kreshinal lost the dagger in a botched gambling scam and was killed by Deder's agents within the month. Deder attempted to reclaim the dagger from the Sembian criminals who had captured it. He succeeded at routing the thieves and reclaiming his dagger, but he focused so much attention on the blade that he didn't notice that the Sembian criminals had employed a priest of Mask to infiltrate and break down his interests in Westgate. The ensuing war between the Westgate and Selgaunt factions ended when the priest of Mask, Pieter the Feeble, made the two sides so paranoid that they ate themselves away from the inside. Pieter grabbed the dagger when he had the opportunity and escaped to Hillsfar, confident that the unorganized demihuman supporters of the late Deder Seven Fingers wouldn't follow him to a place so hostile to their kind.

In yet another scam, Pieter sold the blade to a Mulmaster Hawk while luring other potential buyers to an auction in Hillsfar. Pieter and his associates murdered the buyers at the fake auction and made off with the cash, hiding under the cover of an amulet of non-detection. The Mulmaster Hawk who purchased the blade was supposedly killed by priestesses of Umberlee who were angry at the assassin's refusal to pay tribute to the Bitch Queen. Years of factional fighting between the Umberlants are believed to have transported the blade as much as three thousand miles away from its humble beginnings in Sembia. The whereabouts of Pieter the Feeble and his goons are currently unknown.

@19407 = ~Don't trust Nym. That creature has a heart to match the shade of his skin. Some say that he used to be a member of a noble house.~
@19408 = ~It's a good thing most of our women got to safety long ago. Dirty Llew would... ugh.~
@19409 = ~I hear that Malavon hired some drow mercenaries to help the orogs fortify Upper Dorn's.~
@19410 = ~I long for the day when my brothers and sisters will be back with us again.~
@19411 = ~I hate umber hulks. Hate 'em. Put them under the control of a drow like Malavon and they're three times as bad.~
@19412 = ~There's a fallen temple to Berronar towards the east in Lower Dorn's. No slaves are allowed in. Some say that the corrupted priests there have turned their followers into giant skeletons... and worse.~
@19413 = ~People keep on talking about how the fire giants and Maiden Ilmadia are taking apart the Great Forge—but the Great Forge is across the sea of fire. They already took that apart. What they're trying to do now is take apart the refinery portals. They purify the ore and allow elementals to cross into this world.~
@19414 = ~The only reason the umber hulks serve Malavon is because he feeds them ore and gems that *we* mine. He blinded a tribe of minotaurs to help the hulks guard his domes. The minotaur's sense of smell guides them towards intruders.~
@19415 = ~Some say that a failed paladin wanders the halls of Lower Dorn's, eternally searching for those responsible for the war between the elves and the dwarves.~
@19416 = ~Nym gets to our village by levitating up through that black hole. It's rumored that somewhere around here, there's a stash of potions and boots that can allow others to levitate...~
@19417 = ~Marketh is guarded by two men—brothers named Fleezum and Flozem. Fleezum does just about anything Marketh asks him to do. Flozem doesn't seem to care much about Marketh *or* his brother.~
@19418 = ~Malavon wasn't always a lieutenant of the mad priest. His predecessor was a human wizard in red robes. He's the one who created the orogs. Malavon tricked him, though, and transformed him into an umber hulk.~
@19419 = ~The priest in the bloody robes doesn't like it when his servants fail in their duties or behave erratically. That's why Ilmadia was sent to watch over the fire giants.~
@19420 = ~Stay away from Shikata, the salamander king. He might look like all the others, but he's far more powerful. I know a svirfneblin who tried to hit him with a rock. He was burned to ash before Shikata even reached him.~
@19421 = ~At the core of druidic faith lies the balance between nature and all living things; it is this balance which allows the cycle of nature to continue, grow, and prosper. When this balance is disrupted, then nature, and all those that live within its bounds, is harmed. So taught the elder druids, and you have taken their teachings to heart. 

You are but a new initiate of nature, yet of late, something has disturbed you. It started not long ago with a strange scent upon the air, carrying the hint of storms that should not be, and flocks of birds from the northern reaches, migrating south earlier than is custom. Even the earth itself began whispering to you in the night, telling of evil creatures stirring within its depths. Something is wrong, and the source of the disturbances seems to lie somewhere in the North. You have taken it upon yourself to travel to the Spine of the World and find the meaning behind these disturbances to the balance, and to see if they portend some greater evil within the region. Nature must be protected, and the balance must be restored.~
@19422 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation ceremony into the clergy, you were summoned before the head of your temple. In a cordial, if somewhat cold meeting with the high priest, you were assigned your first duty as a full member of the temple: to make a pilgrimage to the North and see if you could spread the faith to the frontier towns. Almost as an afterthought, the high priest informed you of his "concerns" over portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to soothe potential troubles in the region.

Though these pilgrimages are often considered an unwanted duty by the more politically minded clergymen of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to bring enlightenment to the people of the North, a chance to make a difference rather than falling in a routine and simply presiding over the usual services within the temple. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, with only a staff in hand and the doctrines of your faith firmly etched in your mind.~
@19423 = ~Although the life of a warrior has always held your heart, the huge cities and bustling crowds of southern Faerûn has made you restless. You have tired of following the orders of too many career-minded officers that seek office rather than success on the battlefield, and become irritated by the presence of so many soldiers upon the streets looking for work, that it seemed oftentimes you couldn't swing a blade on a street without hitting a newly formed mercenary company. Perhaps it was for this reason you chose to head to the North, where the untamed wilderness would be a better place to seek one's fortune, and the lands themselves had yet to be broken by the passage of man and the slow creep of civilization. Perhaps in the shadow of the Spine of the World, you can find the adventure and glory you seek, and a chance to carve a name for yourself in the snow-covered lands.~
@19424 = ~This room is dominated by mineral deposits and crystals. It seems to be a natural cavern that this strange prison has been built around. The air holds an aura of power and several pools with swirling lights grace the edge of the rough cavern.~
@19425 = ~There comes a time, even early in one's career, where one must seek inspiration... and it has become clear to you that to look for it in the more civilized regions of Faerûn will only serve to kill your artistic spirit. You have heard too many versions of the same tune, the same chords, a slight spin on a phrase or a rhyme, and in the end, you have come to believe that it is the sheer number of artists feeding upon each other's works has led to a certain stagnation. You cannot bear one more ballad around the fire in an inn's common room nor competing with your fellow minstrels in the crowded taverns to the south—you need to go in search of new tales and songs, seek out new composers and artists. It is this that has driven you to the North. Perhaps your travels in the wilderness will shake the dust from your soul... perhaps even draw you into fantastic adventures that would inspire new tales and light up the taverns of the south! The North beckons, and with it, the promise of something new.~
@19426 = ~This machine buzzes with electrical energy.~
@19427 = ~Upholding all that is right and good is a crusade that knows no boundaries, nor is it confined to a nation or its borders. It is a fight for the spirit, and you are more than a soldier of the faith—you are an example for others, and it is your duty to lift them up, show them that they can become better men and women than they are. The road is a difficult one, but you know that valor and courage in the face of adversity carry their own rewards. 

While there are many who fight the good fight, of late it has concerned you that there are few representatives of good upon the frontier, where civilization is slowly taking root. It cannot be argued that there is still much that can be done within the cities and towns of Faerûn, but it struck you that the North is where future battles for the soul of its people may be fought and won now, simply by providing the ideals for a new civilization and defending all that would threaten it. Within the shadow of the Spine of the World, perhaps you can help a growing civilization learn the virtues that guide your own life and pave the way for a nobler future for its people.~
@19428 = ~It's a well-known saying that fortunes change. Many people believe this, but they never seem to understand that not only do fortunes change, but they sometimes change hands as well. You came upon this realization while you were hurriedly gathering what belongings you could carry to leave town. Though you're relatively certain that discovering the identity of the shadowy figure behind the second-story robbery of those merchants in the inn will be difficult for the city watch, you have no doubts that the priests who found their private cache within the temple vault plundered won't hesitate to call down every divination they can to root you out. All of these minor problems could also carry the unwanted complication of alerting the local thieves' guild—an unsavory bunch of fellows whom you had yet to introduce yourself to—to your presence within their territory.

So, with a heavy heart, you have left the gold-paved streets of your home, and have chosen to make a pilgrimage to the North. Perhaps in a few years, it will be safe enough for you to return to your old haunts, but until then, you'd much rather see what the frontier towns have to offer in the way of fortune. After all, fortunes change—even if they do so more frequently when you're around.~
@19429 = ~Scout, soldier, guide, hunter... these careers have long held no interest for you, and it was becoming clear that no matter how far you traveled within Faerûn, escaping from these roles would be difficult. At heart, you have always been an explorer, one willing to search out new lands and discover all that nature holds within it. Yet it seemed that unless you moved quickly, you would become embroiled in hunting poachers and the policing of trade routes that were beginning to claim too much of your time. 

So you have set upon your path northwards, where the wilderness of the North has yet to be tamed by the passage of man, and nature still exists in its pristine state without the touch of civilization. Within the snows and the ice lie many of nature's secrets, and they call to you, asking to be discovered. Perhaps there you can find a measure of peace and contentment denied to you in the south.~
@19430 = ~The study of magic opened your eyes, not just to the arcane arts, but to the world itself. With every spell you learned in college, every scrap about magic and the arcane arts that you absorbed, you were fascinated with how each piece of information carried with it a certain history, a window into another land or the writings and mind of another practitioner of magic. It was not long before the libraries and the halls of the college began to seem oppressive, more like mausoleums than places of learning. You did not want to meet the fate of some of the elderly college scribes and librarians, lost within their books—you wanted to travel, see what the world held for anyone with a passion for exploration and knowledge. You didn't want to spend your life reading of other's discoveries—you wanted to make some of your own and allow others to benefit from it. 

Shortly after graduation, you set about planning your travels. Who knows what lost knowledge lies within the wilderness of the North, simply waiting for someone to uncover it?~

Guided by the archdruid's cryptic last words, the adventurers prepared to enter the crumbling tower and seek out this mysterious "Larrel" in the hopes that he might have the power to use the Heartstone Gem. For without the vision of the Gem, the evil in the pass might never be revealed, and the town of Kuldahar would be doomed to a frozen fate.~ [NARR_CH3]

@19444 = ~I... I...~
@19445 = ~I... I accidentally fell... down the stairs.~
@19446 = ~No. I don't get a chance to talk to people very much. Marketh doesn't have many visitors, and I... I can't really leave.~
@19447 = ~Please don't hurt him! It's not Marketh's fault. It's mine, really. I shouldn't have made him angry.~
@19448 = ~I... I'll try.~
@19449 = ~My... brother Malavon. He placed a series of spells on me. If I ever cross the boundaries of the palace, the first two spells will destroy my natural resistance to magic. The third spell will extinguish my life force.~
@19450 = ~I... I spoke to him in drow. It was wrong of me.~
@19451 = ~No! Please, don't. Whatever he's done, you must promise me you won't hurt him.~
@19452 = ~I should have seen it coming. I abused Malavon constantly while he was growing up. When Revered Brother Poquelin and his lieutenants met with my people, I slighted Marketh. I wouldn't speak to him because he was male. Instead, I spoke with Maiden Ilmadia. After long discussion, our city could find no reason to ally with Poquelin.~
@19453 = ~Unlike the rest of my people, Malavon wanted to join with the Revered Brother. I discovered this, so he abducted me and took me to Marketh for "safekeeping." They eventually found out anyway. Now Poquelin is planning some sort of assault on my former home. And I... I am left here with Marketh.~
@19454 = ~Thank you. I understand why you're here. It has something to do with Poquelin, doesn't it? Listen, I know this will sound crazy, but I'm sure that Marketh could be a better person somehow if he could just get out of here.~
@19455 = ~If you want to break up Poquelin's army, you'll need each of the lieutenant's badges. Marketh has one. They open an invisible barrier at the back of the fallen temple. Brother Perdiem and his undead fellows watch over it. Whatever you need to do, please... don't hurt Marketh. It's not his fault that he does bad things...~
@19456 = ~H... hello again. Did you want something?~
@19457 = ~In that case, we have nothing to talk about. Farewell.~
@19458 = ~I could, but... I, I need to stay here with Marketh. He needs me. Thank you for trying to help me, though...~
@19459 = ~Now that Marketh has left, I... I suppose there's no reason for me to stay here. I... I don't know what else to do. I suppose I should take the potion and leave this dead palace. Thank you for your help, and farewell.~
@19460 = ~*sob* *sob* You... you killed him. You killed Marketh! You didn't have to, but you did it anyway. Why? WHY?!~
@19461 = ~Just... just GET AWAY FROM ME! *sob* *sob*~

Once my plans have come to bear fruit, I will have access to the master himself. You would do well to remember that from this day forward, worm. 

Also know that your lack of aid has not gone unnoticed. Only your silence in not reporting this to the master has kept you alive. When the time is right, *I* will tell the master that I have taken my father's throne. Until then, you will remain silent or you will die. Those walls you hide behind will not save you from my wrath.

As you know by now, your master and creator is gone. Malavon, Saablic's associate, will now be handling all magical affairs in the dome north of the Artisan's District. You are the strongest of your kind, and thus it is to you that I extend Saablic's badge of lieutenancy. Use it as a symbol of the authority that I have loaned to you. If ever you and the others need to have audience with me, you must bring your badge with you. Think of it as a key—one of six keys to a lock. Do not lose it.

I am placing you and the other orogs in charge of defending the upper reaches of Dorn's Deep. It is your new home. Do with it what you wish, but always submit to my will and to the will of Ilmater. Your nearest peer is Kreg Frostbeard in Wyrm's Tooth. If you are in need of assistance, call upon him and his kin for aid. Defend the stronghold with your lives, for if you survive in failure, your suffering will be monumental.

If you have trouble understanding any portion of this letter, have Adinirahc or one of the other drow mercenaries explain it to you.

Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell infects the creature the caster touches with a rapidly spreading brown mold. If the infected creature fails a Save vs. Spell, the infection is severe and the creature takes magic damage as follows:

1st round: 4d6 damage
2nd round: 3d6 damage
3rd round: 2d6 damage
4th round: 1d6 damage

If the Saving Throw is successful, the damage is reduced as follows:

1st round: 2d6 damage
2nd round: 1d6 damage
3rd round: 1d6 damage

Each round after the first, the nearest creature within 10 ft. of the victim must make a Save vs. Spell or be infected by the mold at full strength. This process continues until the mold fails to infect a suitable host in time. Creatures already under the effects of the mold cannot contract it again. The brown mold quickly dies once the spell expires.~

This spell creates nine darts that can be used by the caster and cannot be unequipped so long as the spell is in effect. The darts are +3, do 1d4+3 missile damage, and a creature struck by a dart must save vs. Death or take 2d6 magic damage and have its Strength reduced by 3 for 5 rounds. Strength reduction is noncumulative, and failing a save while the reduction is in effect will not extend its duration. The caster's weapon proficiency with darts (or lack thereof) has no effect on the darts' chances to hit a target.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell conjures forth seven magical orbs that float in a ring above the caster's head. Each eye has a defensive and offensive ability, though once either one is used, the eye will lose its power. The powers of each eye are described below.

Eye of the Mind: This orb protects the caster against mental attacks such as charm, emotion, and fear. The eye can be expended as the 1st-level wizard spell Charm Person, bringing a humanoid creature under the caster's control for 1 turn (Save vs. Spell negates).

Eye of the Sword: This eye deflects the first physical damaging attack that strikes the caster. The eye may be expended as the 1st-level wizard spell Magic Missile, creating up to 5 missiles (one for every two levels of experience besides the first) that each strike a target for 1d4+1 magic damage.

Eye of the Mage: This eye absorbs one manifestation of fire, electrical, cold, or acid damage. The eye can also be expended as the 3rd-level wizard spell Lightning Bolt, dealing 1d6 electrical damage per level (capped at 10d6) to all creatures in its path.

Eye of Venom: This eye halts any one attack or effect that could poison the caster. The eye can also be expended as the 4th-level priest spell Poison, dealing 20 points of damage to one creature over a period of 20 seconds (Save vs. Poison negates).

Eye of the Spirit: This eye blocks one instant-death magic attack (Death Spell; Finger of Death; Power Word, Kill; Slay Living; Destruction). The wizard may instead choose to expend the eye's power as the 2nd-level wizard spell Ray of Enfeeblement, dropping a target's Strength to 5 (Save vs. Spell negates).

Eye of Fortitude: This eye blocks one stunning, deafness, blindness, or silence effect. It may alternatively be expended as the 4th-level wizard spell Shout, dealing 4d6 magic damage and deafening creatures within a 35-ft. cone (Save vs. Spell halves damage and negates deafness).

Eye of Stone: This eye shields the caster from a single petrification attack. It can also be used as the 3rd-level wizard spell Hold Person, rendering humanoids of man-size or smaller immobile for 1 round/level (Save vs. Spell negates).~

Level: 3
Sphere: Guardian, Creation
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 3-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell conjures forth a barrier of floating bones that spin rapidly around the caster, who cannot move for the duration of the spell. Anyone entering the path of the bones takes 1d6 crushing damage and 1d6 slashing damage per round. Circle of Bones cannot be cast by good-aligned characters.~
@21468 = ~Shout
(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc
Saving Throw: Special

Shout grants the wizard tremendous vocal powers, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to emit an earsplitting roar from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a cone-shaped area of effect. Any creature within this area is deafened for 9 rounds and suffers 4d6 points of magic damage. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the deafness and reduces the damage by half.~
@21469 = ~Suffocate
(Alteration)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 7-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell draws the breath out of all creatures within the area of effect. Creatures that do not breathe are unaffected. Suffocating creatures suffer -4 to Armor Class, -4 to hit, -6 to Dexterity, one less attack per round, half movement rate, and take 4d8 points of magic damage per round. A successful Saving Throw negates all effects but 2d8 points of damage for one round. The effects begin to fade when the creature moves out of the area of effect, although it can take a round for a character to catch their second wind.~
@21470 = ~Great Shout
(Invocation)

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 15-deg. arc
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon uttering the Great Shout, the caster releases a stunning force from <PRO_HISHER> mouth in a 17-ft. cone. The Great Shout is extremely taxing and dangerous to the user. The shout drains 2d4 Hit Points from the caster, and <PRO_HESHE> must make a Save vs. Spell or fall unconscious for 1 turn. Creatures 5 Hit Dice and under caught within the Great Shout instantly die. All other creatures within the area of effect must save vs. Spell. Those who fail the save are stunned for 2 rounds, deafened for 4 rounds, and suffer 4d12 points of magic damage. Those who make the save are stunned for 1 round, deafened for 2 rounds, and suffer 2d12 points of magic damage.~
@21471 = ~Iron Body
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transforms the caster's body into living iron, granting <PRO_HIMHER> several powerful resistances and abilities. While the spell is in effect, the caster is 100% resistant to electricity and poison, 50% resistant to fire, and 25% resistant to crushing damage. Spells that affect respiration or the physiology of the caster are ignored. In addition, the caster's Strength is raised to 25, and the caster can attack twice per round with iron fists for 2d4 points of damage plus appropriate Strength bonuses.

Unfortunately, the caster's movement becomes slow and awkward, setting <PRO_HISHER> movement rate to 25% of <PRO_HISHER> normal, and <PRO_HESHE> cannot cast spells while Iron Body is in effect.~

Sphere: Elemental Air
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a small whirlwind within the caster's sight. The whirlwind will fly around randomly, harming friend and foe alike. The caster is immune to <PRO_HISHER> own spell, and elementals and other huge creatures are also unaffected. If a creature is caught in the path of the whirlwind, it takes 2d8 crushing damage, 2d8 slashing damage, and must make a Save vs. Breath Weapon or be stunned for 2 rounds. Creatures with 2 or fewer Hit Dice are automatically killed by this spell. A maximum of 8 targets can be affected, after which the whirlwind will dissipate.~

Upon completion of this spell, the priest becomes a focus of spiritual energy, which then shoots out from the caster in four directions, like lightning bolts. All creatures in the bolts' paths take 4d10 points of magic damage (save vs. Spell for half). Creatures of the same moral alignment (good, neutral, evil) as the caster are unaffected by the spell.~

This spell instantly destroys a target, blasting it into small chunks. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Death at a penalty of -4; if successful, the target takes 8d6 points of magic damage instead of being destroyed. Destruction can only be cast by evil characters. Note that a character struck with a Destruction spell cannot be raised from the dead with a Raise Dead or Resurrection spell.~

Duration: 8 hours

When this spell is cast, a brilliant ray of scorching heat slants down from the sky and strikes one target of the caster's choice. Any creature struck by the ray takes 1d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per level of the caster; however, if the target is an undead creature or a monster vulnerable to bright light, the damage is 1d6, plus 2 points per level of the caster. In addition to sustaining damage, victims are also blinded for 3 rounds. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Spell for half damage and to avoid the blindness.~
@21480 = ~Amaunator's Legacy +3~
@21481 = ~This shiny brass sword is extremely old, dating back at least three thousand years before Dale Reckoning. It was created by a Netherese archmage named Pouldinus as a gift to a warrior friend. This friend, Kalamnin, was a strict devotee of Amaunator, a harsh, unforgiving god now almost forgotten by sages. Amaunator was the god of law and the god of the sun. He required his servants to follow his edicts exactly. Kalamnin did his best to observe Amaunator's laws in his travels. The blade was lost when Kalamnin was killed in battle by dozens of nycadaemons. The sorcerer who summoned the creatures, Ylmandi, kept the blade in his family until the fall of Netheril.

@21483 = ~This grim item was fashioned by priests of Myrkul, god of the dead. The heavy leather belt is set with metal plates and hoops that hold human bones. The original owner was a deadly warrior named Proud Keth. Keth rode across battlefields without fear, smashing whoever got in his way. On those rare occasions when he was surrounded, the belt came in handy. Unfortunately for Keth, his opponents eventually decided to take him down using polearms and long spears. When he was killed, his belt was buried with him. It was only a matter of time before thieves came to Keth's grave in order to loot it. One of the thieves sold Keth's belt to a practical mage from Urmlaspyr. The wizard, Isanan by name, found the belt to be very useful during his travels. When he retired, he sold the belt to a grateful priest of Myrkul named Ben-Karad. Ben-Karad is believed to have been killed somewhere in the sewers of Waterdeep.

@21485 = ~A weapon of grim reputation in the Frozen North, Blood Iron was crafted by a wicked barbarian shaman named Hekedder. He gave the sword to a cousin as a gift. The weapon saw a good amount of use in various barbarian hands as the years went by. Eventually, each owner found themselves hated for having the weapon in their possession. The taint of necromancy is so deplored by the northern tribes that the cursed name of Blood Iron became common knowledge among them. To this day, barbarians will not touch the cursed weapon and dislike even speaking of it. It is crafted of crude, poorly worked iron, and the surface of the blade is covered in gouge marks and the imprint of bad hammer strikes. The grip is wrapped in bright red leather.

The wizard Cheston of Procampur decided to make some money when he set out to make this particular cloak for the Waukeenar priest Betrand of Suzail. Betrand used the cloak effectively until he came up against a demonic foe that could see right through the illusion. Betrand's body was never found, but the tattered cloak continued to work wonders for Betrand's comrade, the thief Dacon Blackwood. Dacon eventually ran afoul of a thieves' guild in Sembia. He was believed to have escaped their wrath by traveling to Berdusk. How this cloak arrived at its recent resting place is unknown.

Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body. To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem. Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby. One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it. He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword. Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat. Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks, and he threw it into the street. A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership. Over time, the weapon has simply come to be known by its current name.

@21491 = ~Rods of smiting are extremely uncommon weapons, though they can be very useful against some foes. This particular rod was last in the possession of a priest of Gond named Debian of Urmlaspyr. Debian was an eccentric adventurer who took it upon himself to investigate every type of golem that had been reported in the realms. In many cases, the creator of the golem would send his or her creations after Debian for his snooping. Debian usually escaped without much personal harm. Unfortunately for Debian, his luck ran out when he investigated the lair of the Machinery Man, a bizarre lich who happened to be a creator of golems and other animated constructs. The Machinery Man's lab full of iron golems proved to be too much for Debian to overcome.

The elf's tower was also filled with a variety of abnormal spiders. For over a year, Caligope refused to even look at the tower. Eventually, he decided to construct a club to deal with his fear. The resulting weapon was named the Evil Spider Crusher of Doom. Caligope succeeded in his quest to rob Eil-Makar blind, and he left dozens of dead spiders in his wake.

However, the large temple requires a huge body of standing soldiers to protect it from attackers and spies. The head of the temple guard is known as the Whip of Obedience. He used to be traditionally equipped with a magical halberd called the Icon of Power. When the temple guards saw the Icon pass them on their rounds, they took a little more care in their duties. Unfortunately for the Whip, a clever human thief from Elturel decided to capture the Icon as a personal challenge. The thief, whose name is still unknown, succeeded at his task and sold the Icon to the church of Bane. The Banites held the Icon out of contempt for the late Whip's incompetence. Eventually, the Icon was lost when the desert temple where it was held, the Obsidian Chapel, was sacked by Bedine raiders.

@21597 = ~A philosopher mage named Giddeon the Believer was the creator of this weapon. He claimed that there were natural "currents" of energy that existed throughout the world. To tap into the power behind these currents, Giddeon stated, a wizard simply needed to understand how they functioned. Once he or she understood the flow of energy, he or she could theoretically draw power from it through spellcasting or through a "focus device." When Giddeon's laboratory was destroyed by a colossal explosion in 1010 DR, this spear was one of the only items that survived. The spear guides itself along natural lines of energy as it veers towards its targets. Rarely, the spear will tap into a line of latent power and cause it to explode in a shaft of violent force.

Kadan parted with the weapon, however, when he crossed paths with the infamous Nido Ochita Inazuma in western Faerûn. Inazuma was the son of a Cormyrean knight and a Kara-Turian noblewoman. He claimed that his mother was struck by lightning twice while she was pregnant with Inazuma—once when she learned she had conceived and again immediately before she gave birth. Legends say that Inazuma was born on the edge of the Fateful Coin, the mystical method by which Tymora and Beshaba decide whether a person will have good or bad luck throughout his or her life. Sages believe that Inazuma's coin landed on edge, making him immune to the effects of weal and woe. When he came across Kadan and his scimitar, it was only a matter of time before the Zakharan gambled his scimitar and his life into Inazuma's hands.

His robes were extremely popular, so much so that mages were coming to him from all over the world to demand that he make more for them. Delgam decided to fade into obscurity rather than cater to packs of power-hungry wizards. His robes are his most well-known legacy.

Bordel and a group of fellow explorers would specify a location in Faerûn to march to. The contestants would then hike to the location by the quickest route possible. Bordel won far more of the competitions than he lost, and he had a reputation for having extremely heavy footsteps. This earned him the nickname "Stomper." When Bordel died in a rockslide, he was buried in the wilderness. Several years after his death, rumors began circulating that Bordel's boots were actually enchanted to make him sound loud when he approached. This rumor spiraled out of control, eventually going so far as to say that Bordel's boots were capable of shaking down houses with their weight. By the time thieves stole the boots ten years after Bordel's death, they had taken on the properties that so many people believed they possessed.

Alledec had been a fighting priest for the order for twenty years, and he decided it was time to leave a legacy for the church to use after he had passed away. This ivory-headed mace was the result. The shaft of the weapon is made from black-enameled steel, with the handle being crafted of carved ivory. Gold bands lock the head and the handle into place. The head itself is the most unusual part of the mace. It is carved from pure ivory, and it resembles three white doves facing the center of the weapon. The flared wings of the doves form the flanges.

Alledec died in his sleep three years after completing the mace. It was given to a traveling fighter in service of the church of Ilmater. The fighter later passed the weapon on to a priest of Ilmater named Recken the Bold. Recken lost the weapon when he was fighting a powerful vampire near Trollbark Forest. Recken was eventually victorious over the vampire, but he never recovered the mace.

Instead, she devoted herself to performing ballads to the suffering throngs of Ilmatari everywhere. She was traveling with a group of Ilmatari pilgrims when they were attacked by bandits. The bandits killed and severely injured many of the pilgrims, and they cut the strings of Sephica's harp when she tried to soothe the injured travelers. After the bandits had left, Sephica prayed to Ilmater for help in a time of crisis. When she plucked at her harp strings with her eyes closed in prayer, music miraculously poured forth and healed every person who heard it. The next day, the bandits arrived and killed Sephica for healing the pilgrims. Though she was killed, the pilgrims kept the memory of her miracle alive. Their community attempted to have her accepted as an Ilmatari saint. They succeeded in 1218 DR.

Huge, fast, and cunning, he was more than a match for his kinsmen. On a journey into the Spine of the World, Hegelfden captured two dwarves that he came across in a cave. He refused to let the two workers go until they created a magnificent axe for him. The two dwarves reluctantly agreed, creating a stout battle axe with a keen blade and a thick handle. When the dwarves asked to be released, Hegelfden denied their request. He wanted to keep them as servants. The dwarves then laid a curse upon Hegelfden. They told him that the fruit of his abuse would be the end of him. Hegelfden laughed at the dwarves' claim and continued on with his life. The next day, in a battle with a rival tribe, Hegelfden went berserk with blood lust, slaying every creature he came across. His kin, convinced that he had gone mad, cut him down where he stood. The axe was left on the field when the warriors brought Hegelfden's body back to the camp. When they arrived, the dwarves were nowhere to be found.

Bala was a foul-tempered prince of a gully dwarf clan, which was enslaved by a cruel elven mage in Thesk. Though Bala managed to escape the more cowardly traits of his race, he was even more filthy and obnoxious than the average gully dwarf. Sickened of his enslavement, Bala crept into the mage's lair and cracked the elf's skull open. Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench that overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates. After a lengthy career of mage-slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards. The axe gives the owner the ability to dispel magic once a day.

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Up to 60-ft. cube
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast the wizard can effect the emotional state of those around <PRO_HIMHER>. The effect of this is to inflict a feeling of hopelessness upon the enemies within the visual range of the caster. Upon a failed save vs. Spell, the effected can be seen to lay down where they stand and appear to give over all will to a higher power. Sometimes they can be heard to exclaim things such as "I lay down and die," or "I'm going home." This will last for the duration of the spell upon which they will return to normal.

The secondary effect of this spell is to instill upon the caster the feeling of courage. This will remove any effects of panic and restore <PRO_HISHER> morale, as well as preventing the above from creeping forth into <PRO_HISHER> psyche. There is no save vs. this and it will last for the duration of the spell. It will, however, be affected by Magic Resistance and other such things.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell encloses the target in a globe of shimmering force for the duration of the spell. The resilient sphere is completely immune to all damage; the only method of removing the sphere is by the use of Dispel Magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time is completely unable to affect the outside world. Hostile creatures can resist the effect with a successful Save vs. Spell.~

Upon casting this spell, the wizard is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with the cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses cannot be countered by this spell, or can be countered only by a caster of a certain level or more.~

Mental attributes are not affected, and the target does not receive the special abilities of the new form. However all physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. This is a specific version of the spell in that the recipient will be transformed into a squirrel unless a save vs. petrification/polymorph is made successfully. The transformation is instant and permanent until Dispel Magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature. The natural attacks of the new form also become available and all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form.~

When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature. The caster also gains the physical mode of locomotion and breathing as well. This spell does not give the new form's other abilities such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.

When the spell is cast, for the duration of the spell the caster can transform into any of the new forms at any time, and as many times as <PRO_HESHE> wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others. The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, however all the physical attributes are attained from the new form. Also, any natural protections that the new form offer are conferred to the wizard, such as the resistance to missile and blunt weapons possessed by the slime.~

@22443 = ~Well, you know *why* he bought the inn? Bet you don't.~
@22444 = ~No... why did he buy the inn?~
@22445 = ~Hailee, I don't have time for guessing games. Why did he buy the inn?~
@22446 = ~ 'Cause it has a *magic mirror*! Uh-huh, it's true! I saw him step right through it... well, I mean, he *opens* it first, but it's *like* he's walking right through it!~
@22447 = ~I believe you. I know of this door already. Thanks for telling me, though, Hailee.~
@22448 = ~Are you telling another tale, Hailee?~
@22449 = ~The mirror's a door? Hmmm. Perhaps I'll ask Kieran about it.~

When he arrived in Baldur's Gate, he hired himself out as a mercenary, thug, and caravan guard, quickly earning a reputation as an incredibly unreasonable and hot-tempered man. Within his first six months in Baldur's Gate, he had been arrested five times and was known to have almost killed at least four different people who accidentally looked him in the eye for a moment too long. Somehow, however, Bael attracted a small following of easily impressionable thugs who joined him on his seedy adventures. Eventually, Bael managed to scrape together enough money to pay a wizard to craft a powerful sword for him. The Blade of Bael aided its owner well until the mean-spirited brute decided to rough up and harass a young priestess of Eldath. When local Tempurans heard what Bael had done, they descended on him in the street and beat him with clubs, then threw him into the bay. They took his sword to their temple and later auctioned it off to a worthy owner.

When she grew tired of her consorts, as she always did, she would give the matching ring to a new lover and send the young man out to kill her old paramour. The new lover would simply call upon the ring and the mace would fly to his hand. 

Unfortunately, Redani was done in when she trusted the wrong man to kill her old lover. Gural of Chessenta, a well-disguised priest of Hoar, took it upon himself to gain vengeance for a man whose skull he had picked up by the side of a road. Unluckily for Redani, priests of Hoar will go to any length to avenge the dead, even if it means animating all of her dead lovers to tear her limb from limb.

The weapon has an unearthly look to it, and it is believed to be quite old. The only individual known to have carried the weapon was a half-elven bard named Daen Winterbrush. It is said by some that after he found the sword, quite by accident, he was blessed with exceptional creativity and powerful sensitivity to the world around him. He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerûn. It is believed that Daen eventually became too melancholy at the sights of misery and oppression that he encountered in his travels, and that the fae smiths of the Moonshae Isles welcomed him into the breast of Myrloch.

(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is very similar to the 3rd-level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates an incorporeal barrier around the target's body for the duration of the spell. This spell, however, actually taps in to the target's life force in order to create the barrier. The armor itself is weightless and does not hinder movement or spellcasting at all.

Spirit Armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor; however, Dexterity bonuses still apply, as well as magic rings and shield bonuses. While in effect, the Armor Class of the recipient will be 1, as if <PRO_HESHE> were wearing plate mail. Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, <PRO_HESHE> will also receive a +3 bonus to saves vs. Spell.

There is a danger, however, as when the spell runs out, the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2d4 points of magic damage upon the target.~
@22610 = ~Chaos~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

The effects of this spell are identical to the 4th-level spell Confusion in all respects. The victims wander around as if in a daze, sometimes wandering away, sometimes attacking either friend or foe. If the victim is 4th level or lower, <PRO_HESHE> does not receive a Saving Throw versus the effects. However, if the victim is 5th level or higher, <PRO_HESHE> receives a Save vs. Spell at -4. The spell lasts for the duration or until a successful Dispel Magic is cast.~
@22612 = ~Feeblemind~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell turns a target into a gibbering idiot, which lasts until Dispel Magic is cast upon <PRO_HIMHER>. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Spell at -2 to resist being stupefied. Feebleminded individuals cannot cast spells. The priest spell Heal will remove feeblemindedness from an afflicted character.~
@22614 = ~Domination~
@22615 = ~Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

Domination enables the caster to control the actions of any creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against <PRO_HISHER> morals, except, of course, Dispel Magic. The target gets a Save vs. Spell at -2 in order to avoid the effect.~
@22616 = ~Hold Monster~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 enemies of any type (except for undead) rigidly immobile. Specifically, it affects the targeted enemy and up to 3 hostile creatures within 10 ft. of it. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the effect.

Paralyzed creatures are helpless and cannot dodge or defend themselves from attacks. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~
@22618 = ~Mental Domination~
@22619 = ~Mental Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Sphere: Thought
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

When Mental Domination is cast upon a subject, <PRO_HESHE> must make a Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty in order to prevent the priest from entering <PRO_HISHER> mind. Elves and half-elves have no innate resistance to this spell. The priest can force the subject into combat, but the subject's attack rolls suffer a -2 penalty. The priest cannot force the subject to cast spells or use any innate magical or spell-like abilities.~

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to electrical attacks such as a blue dragon's breath, Lightning Bolt, Shocking Grasp, etc. The protection will last for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled.~

@22674 = ~From here, you must go alone. The people of this town will know the way to the camp of my people.~ [HJOLL020]
@22675 = ~Travel swiftly and safely. We shall meet again when you stand before the council in the great mead hall.~ [HJOLL021]
@22676 = ~I am honored by your choice. The journey is a long one, and our quest is urgent. I shall summon the wind to carry us through the mountains and over the tundra.~ [HJOLL022]
@22677 = ~Know this... should you wish to return to this place, it is within my power to bring you back. But walking upon the wind taxes one's spirit greatly.~ [HJOLL023]

@22694 = ~The Vampire's Revenge~
@22695 = ~It would seem that the very speculation of this weapon's existence has conspired to pull it from the realm of fantasy and into the everyday, though, as with all things that come from dreams, it is not as it truly seems. The blade is indeed vampiric, as the name would suggest; though not in the manner the finder might have hoped. It is rumored that the blade, instead of performing as one might think a vampiric blade would, was actually constructed by vampires as a trap for those that could eventually oppose them. These incredibly clever fiends have apparently fashioned numerous versions of these unfortunate blades over time, and they are the bane of all right-thinking adventurers. Each swing actually inflicts damage upon the wielder, as his life energies are drained in order to heal his intended victim. Were this not enough, the weapon is cursed so as to prevent it's removal, and the user is smitten with a wasting of the mind, that he might not even think of trying to rid himself of it. This may be among the few magical treasures that are simply not worth the trouble of seeking, and one might better spend ones time having a lovely beverage, rather than gallivanting about the wilderness with a pack full of rubbish chasing phantoms.

While the toll on civilization was great, the true victims were nature's creatures, condemned to stand and watch as their homes decayed and died. As habitats receded, those that remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed the item's ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

Level: 4

Duration: 6 rounds

Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Defensive Harmony allows a group of creatures to act as a single unit for a single battle or encounter, enhancing the coordination of their attacks and tactics. This effect is always centered on the caster but affects all those within a 15-ft. radius. The affected can move outside of this area after the spell is cast and still enjoy the benefits of harmony. While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +4 bonus to their Armor Class. This lasts for 6 rounds or until successfully dispelled.~

Level: 4
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, all creatures within a 15-ft. radius are affected individually by Protection From Evil. Hence, they receive a +2 bonus to Armor Class and Saving Throws against evil-aligned opponents, summoned fiends will not attack them, and they will be immune to all charm-based spells.~

Sphere: Law
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the priest effectively draws on the strength of <PRO_HISHER> deity and lends it to the target creature, in effect creating a champion. The target's Strength is set to 20 – 23 for 1 turn (25% chance of each value). As soon as the spell is cast, the caster becomes fatigued, suffering a penalty to all <PRO_HISHER> rolls. The drawback to this spell is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and <PRO_HISHER> deity for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any additional spells during this time. The effect lasts for one turn or until dispelled.~

A score or more of days pass, but the aptly named Trackless Sea seems to stretch before you without end. The waters are calm, though the wind remains steady and sure.

The merchant vessel your employer has chartered is a fine ship, but her crew is not accustomed to journeys so far off the established trade routes. The more superstitious among them speak of a great waterfall off the edge of Faerûn, of a secret elven nation that scuttles all that dare come near, or even of island-size turtles that eat whole ships. Such fancy weighs heavily on the minds of nervous sailors, and the mood aboard ship slowly turns. Tensions begin to mount, and rumors of mutiny threaten your resolve. It is a mixed blessing that all aboard are soon given a very real danger to occupy their thoughts.

The storm comes without warning, and hits with a fury that seems almost deliberate. Gale force winds toss the ship about like a cork, and it is all the crew can do to keep her afloat. Their efforts, though valiant, are ultimately futile, and when the mainmast splinters you know the ship is lost. As the hull gives way there is a glimpse of something in the distance: a steady illumination against the black of night. Grasping debris for flotation you abandon the wreck, and begin to swim under the heavy burden of your equipment. You head towards the glow, hoping it is not a sea wisp or some other nefarious trick of the eyes.
You awake the next morning with a mouth full of sand. You are waterlogged, exhausted, and you have an aching pain that lets you know you are very much alive. The ship is so much kindling, there is no sign of the crew, but there do appear to be footprints in the sand...~

@23378 = ~The long, curved, single-edged blade is characteristic of both the saber and the scimitar, even though their origins lie in different part of Faerûn. Where as the saber was intended mainly for horsemen, mainly due to its versatility, the scimitar has a heavier oriental influence. The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. The effect of this is that it is slightly slower but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat. This particular weapon has been enhanced magically to complement the skill of the wielder.

Formerly

'A Lovely Bun-cake Brightens Anyone's Day'

The recipes herein are mine own imagining, and thus ingredients are subject to change as per my whim. 
************
Belladonna Bun-cake
A simple little dish for a rainy afternoon.

Cornflour, 
The eggs of a seabird, 
A spoon of the Whitecap fungus,
The fruit of your choice for sweetening, 
One small measure of the belladonna root.
Prepare as one would a breadloaf, though less time given to the rising. 
Bake in a well stoked hearth under leaves for one turn of the hourglass.

Notes to myself: Refrain from eating this ever again. Exceptionally poisonous. Remember the unfortunate week on the kitchen floor. 
************
Dradeel's Vegetable Surprise
A dish that turned out surprisingly edible. Not recommended as the primary meal every day for 300 years. Some disorientation may result.

Place 2 cups of virgin Netherise Olive Oil and 1 large chopped onion in a large pot
Saute onions in oil over medium fire until onions begin to become clear
Add 2 chopped carrots and 2 chopped stalks of celery
Saute for an additional 3 minutes
Add 1 1/2 quarts of water and bring to a boil.

Add 2 diced and peeled potatoes, 1 cup of white wine (I find that a Myth Rhynnian vintage is perfect), 1 bay leaf, 2 diced tomatoes, and chopped parsley to taste.

Cook, covered, over medium-smallish fire until vegetables are almost tender. Add 2 cups of chopped spinach and cook for an additional 15 minutes. Serve hot and garnish with grated cheese.

Note: For orcish version, replace all ingredients with turnips.
************
Curative Ingredients for the Dispelling of Lycanthropy. 
Mother's family recipe

Notes: Mother's topical salve is a rather large failure. Research further with the following in mind: The creatures on this isle are unusual beyond their splitting into two factions. Theirs is an odd curse, one that defies the traditional remedies (such as the unfortunately dangerous muffins previous), though one is not without hope. The exotic origin of the original stock suggest a unique enchantment, not unlike that of the more widely know vampiric afflictions. The casual bite might be averted using such things as the Belladonna flower, but an intentional infection could actually require the extermination of the leader of the clan. This is merely conjecture of course, as I have been unable to examine said leader. Despite my strange immunity, his is a strength that could still inflict a measure of serious damage upon my physical form. He and I have spoken on occasion, though his tolerance of me is no more resilient than mine is of him. 

Further notes to myself: Future offerings of peace to either of the wolf clans should not take the form of muffins of any sort.
************
The Bachelor's Crutch
Noodles of quality and convenience.

Ingredients:
A measure of noodles.
Boiling water
Container

Combine ingredients in container.
Enjoy. Oh yes, enjoy.

Notes to myself: Should probably be supplemented with something of nutritional value, lest my bones become brittle as chalk. Perhaps the container?~

@23553 = ~We spoke with Beornen of the Great Whale Tribe, and he told us what he knew of the spirit that had stolen Wylfdene's body.

@23563 = ~We ran into Hailee's mother at the Whistling Gallows Inn, and she told us that Hailee had played a trick on us.

(Alteration)

Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell magically increases a target's Dexterity. The amount depends on the target's class: Rogues gain 1d8 points, warriors and wizards gain 1d6 points, and priests gain 1d4 points. If a character has more than one class, the larger die is used. Cat's Grace cannot raise a target's Dexterity past 20.~
@24243 = ~Expeditious Retreat
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell doubles the caster's normal speed for a short period of time... usually long enough to escape. Other movement-altering effects, such as Haste and Slow, cannot affect the caster while this spell is in effect. While Expeditious Retreat is active, the caster cannot attack, cast spells, or use any items or special abilities... <PRO_HESHE> can only run.~
@24244 = ~Contact Other Plane
(Divination)

Level: 5
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows the wizard to contact powers from other planes of existence in order to receive advice and information. The nature of the divination is oriented around knowledge of powerful foes, magic items, and spells.~
@24245 = ~Vitriolic Sphere
(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell conjures a sphere of glowing emerald acid that the caster can direct to strike any target within range. When it reaches its target, the sphere explodes and drenches the victim in potent acid. The victim suffers 1d4 points of acid damage per caster level, to a maximum of 12d4 points of damage. After the initial damage, the victim must save vs. Spell to avoid more damage. If unsuccessful, the victim continues to suffer acid damage in the following rounds, sustaining two less dice of damage each round. For example, an 8th-level wizard inflicts 8d4 damage with this spell on the first round, 6d4 on the second round, 4d4 on the third round, 2d4 on the fourth round, and the spell ends on the fifth round. Each round after the first, the victim is entitled to a Save vs. Spell to avoid further damage.

The vitriolic sphere also splashes acid in a 5-ft. radius around the primary target. Any creatures within the splash radius must save vs. Petrification/Polymorph or suffer a splash hit that inflicts 1d4 points of damage per every five levels of the caster. Splash hits do not cause continuing damage.~
@24246 = ~Mordenkainen's Force Missiles
(Invocation)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 2-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell creates a brilliant globe of magical energy that streaks forth from the caster's hand to unerringly strike its target, much like a Magic Missile spell. The wizard creates one missile at 7th level and an additional missile at every third level after 7th—in other words, two missiles at 10th level, three at 13th, four at 16th, and so on, to a maximum of seven missiles at 25th level. Each missile inflicts 2d4 points of damage to the target and then bursts in a 2-ft. radius concussive blast that inflicts 1 point of damage per level of the caster—for example, a 12th-level wizard could conjure two force missiles, each of which strikes for 2d4+12 points of magic damage. Creatures taking damage can attempt a Save vs. Spell to negate the concussion damage, but the impact of the missile itself allows no Saving Throw. The 1st-level wizard spell Shield will absorb the force missiles harmlessly, including the concussion damage.~
@24247 = ~Undead Ward
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Sphere: Wards
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell amplifies the influence a priest has over undead, though it is tied to the area surrounding the priest at the moment of its casting and does not move. Any undead creature entering the area of effect is affected as if turned by the priest that cast this spell. If the turning fails, the undead creature is immune to further turning attempts by the spell unless it leaves and reenters the area of effect.~
@24248 = ~Unfailing Endurance
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Sphere: Necromantic
Range: Touch
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell restores the stamina of the creature touched, eliminating any fatigue.~
@24249 = ~Poison
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Sphere: Healing
Range: Touch
Duration: 20 seconds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell grants the caster the ability to touch a creature and instantly poison it unless it makes a successful Save vs. Poison. The poison deals 20 points of damage over 20 seconds and then dissipates from the target's body. Poison can only be cast by evil-aligned characters.~
@24250 = ~Cloud of Pestilence
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Combat, Elemental Air
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 12-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell transforms the air in a 12-ft. radius into sickening, grayish mists. The caster and non-living creatures are immune to the effects of the cloud. For every round of exposure to the disease-ridden air, a creature must save vs. Breath or suffer 3 points of magic damage, blindness, and the loss of 3 points of Strength and Dexterity. The blindness and ability score penalties last 1 turn. Cloud of Pestilence can only be cast by evil-aligned characters.~
@24251 = ~Animal Rage
(Enchantment)

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: Touch
Duration: 15 rounds
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell imbues the target creature with animal ferocity. The target creature gains a Strength score of 19, +20 Hit Points, +20% movement rate, and a +2 bonus to all Saving Throws. The target loses the ability to cast spells while Animal Rage is in effect; when enemies are within sight, <PRO_HESHE> immediately attacks in melee, using whatever is in hand. While this spell is in effect, there is a 5% chance per round that the target will go berserk, attacking friend and foe alike.~
@24252 = ~Smashing Wave
(Invocation)

Level: 4
Sphere: Elemental Water
Range: 100 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell summons a 5-ft. wide wave of water that moves in the direction willed by the caster, striking all in its path with massive force. The wave deals 4d10 points of crushing damage; in addition, struck creatures may be either stunned (25% chance) or knocked unconscious (5% chance) for 2 rounds. If the creature struck makes a successful Save vs. Breath Weapon, the damage is reduced by half and the creature avoids being stunned or knocked unconscious.~
@24253 = ~Thorn Spray
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Plant
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 17-ft. cone with 90-deg. arc
Saving Throw: 1/2

By means of this spell, the caster can cause a spray of barbs, spikes, thorns, and spines to spring forth from <PRO_HISHER> hand. The thorn spray covers a 17-ft.-long cone, inflicting 2d10 points of piercing damage to all creatures within the area of effect, or 1d10 points of damage if a Save vs. Death is successful.~
@24254 = ~Star Metal Cudgel
(Conjuration)

Level: 4
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a meteoric iron magical club that deals 1d6+2 points of crushing damage, confers a +2 bonus to attack rolls, and is treated as a +4 weapon for purposes of what it can hit. Strength, proficiency, and specialization bonuses and penalties apply normally. The club deals an additional 2d6 points of crushing damage against unnatural creatures (undead, elementals, golems, outer-planar creatures, etc.).~
@24255 = ~Storm Shell
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Sphere: Protection, Weather
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell surrounds the caster with a bright sphere of disruptive energy that moves with <PRO_HIMHER>. The storm shell increases the caster's resistance to fire, cold, and electrical damage by 50%.~
@24256 = ~Moonblade
(Invocation)

Level: 3
Sphere: Combat, Sun
Range: 0
Duration: 2 turns
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell summons forth a silent, weightless sword-like construct made of moonlight that extends four feet from the caster's hand. The moonblade is considered a +4 weapon for determining what creatures it can hit, though the bonus does not apply to attack rolls made with it. In addition, due to the insubstantial nature of the moonblade, melee bonuses from Strength do not apply.

The strike of a moonblade drains a target's vitality, inflicting 1d12+4 points of magic damage, plus an additional 1d12 points to undead, who are particularly susceptible. A successful strike also temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail.~

He was especially well known for his lack of fear of the undead. He considered undead to be, in his words, "unoriginal, tired old jokes." "After the hundredth skeleton," he would say, "what's to be afraid of? They all march at you like horses to water, and you just hack them down one at a time. I'm supposed to be scared of that?" He would wade into tombs with his trusted flail and smash apart any undead that he found, joking all the way. Eventually, Seldon's lack of respect for the necromantic arts earned him an enemy in the form of Tiron, a lich of no small power. Tiron captured Seldon and paralyzed him, letting a group of skeletons beat him to death. Seldon's friends later recovered his body and had him raised from the dead. He was not as lighthearted about the walking dead after that.

Bards sing about the various near-death experiences he escaped from in the simple, if long-winded, tune, "The One Hundred Lives of Ket the Keen." He was also known for two of the weapons he carried. One was his short sword, Bloodfarmer. The other was his dagger, Reliance. It is said that Ket kept this dagger on his person for all of his days, never turning it over to any man, nor keeping it out of arm's reach at any time. He was actually kicked out of the Cormyrean royal court for his stubborn insistence on keeping Reliance, unbound, by his side. After he died, Ket's extremely large family decided to donate the dagger to the church of Arvoreen. The church later gave it to a promising young halfling warrior. The warrior was killed later when he turned over the dagger upon entering a seemingly friendly camp. His hosts turned out to be a pack of bandits. They killed the poor halfling on the spot.

Vicalet was a half-elven mercenary who hired himself out to various adventuring companies as support. He would trail or flank his employers in dangerous environments and shoot any and all mages that he saw. A few mages even tried to use Projected Images to fool Vicalet, but the crafty half-elf always saw through the ruse. Vicalet retired a rich man, and opened a vineyard for himself and his family. He later sold his crossbow to a young, cocky human mercenary. It is believed that the new owner was not as skilled or as crafty as Vicalet, and came to an untimely end.

@24309 = ~A rough bow with a dusty appearance, the Black Bow was created as an instrument of vengeance by a Cormyrean settler in the Western Heartlands of Faerûn. A former soldier named Jonan of Suzail, after years of campaigning in the name of the crown, finally returned home to marry his childhood sweetheart. Through all of his years in the military, he remained true to his love and saved his earnings. He and his new wife moved west in the hopes that they would find frontier land to settle. In the lands north of Baldur's Gate and east of the Trollbark Forest, Jonan built his home and farm. Within five years, there were raiders in the area, and farms were being destroyed all around Jonan's. Eventually, the raiders targeted Jonan's home, killing his wife and child and leaving him for dead. His farm was burned to the ground. Weeks later, Jonan crafted this bow and rubbed the ashes of his farm and family into the grain of the wood. He later went on a murderous rampage, slaying each of the bandits where he found them, and later killing anyone they associated with. Sages debate how the bow became enchanted, but most believe that, after Jonan's death, it was blessed by a god. Some say it was blessed by Tyr, some say by Hoar, and others say by Bhaal. Theories tend to revolve around whether the speaker believes Jonan's actions were just, vengeful, or murderous.

They were well known for their detailed battle tactics and organized fighting formations. When they fought especially powerful foes, their two dwarves and two halflings would rush the front to surround their target. The humans and elves would then strike with halberds and bows from the back ranks. This particular halberd belonged to Bedwyn Fayr, one of the best halberdiers in the company. The company's tactics fell apart in 1252 DR when an unknown party with superior tactics decided to take the group out. Only Fayr and one halfling, Pep Greenfields, survived the assault. Fayr and Pep decided that Tymora had given them a sign. They sold their adventuring gear and opened a profitable antique shop in Waterdeep.

To make himself appear mundane, he wore the clothes of a pilgrim and carried a simple elm walking staff. In reality, the staff was magically enchanted to be more potent in combat, but Eron didn't want to risk advertising that fact.

Durlow's hammer, like many dwarven weapons, was forged and blessed with power by priests of Moradin. It earned its name in Durlow's service, where he used it to drive back drow wizards and their summoned abyssal allies. Legends say that Durlow even defeated one of the dreaded Yochlol, the "Handmaidens of Lolth." Durlow met his end when the drow employed treachery to defeat him. Under magical disguise, drow assassins visited Durlow's fortified city as human ambassadors from Tethyr. They then poisoned Durlow's food, which he ate in front of them. Durlow eventually realized what was happening and managed to stumble to his room and grab Hellpick. In the resulting battle, Durlow managed to kill four of the five assassins before he fell victim to the effects of the poison. The fifth assassin is believed to have escaped.

When the nervous defenders tried to form a line of pikes, Kath and other heavily armored men would wade into the fray, hacking their weapons apart and breaking their formation. Once the villagers had been sent into disarray, his men would fall in with cavalry and take what they wanted. Kath eventually met his end when a rival warlord, Marhap the Blackbeard, destroyed Kath's army.

@24556 = ~All right.~
@24557 = ~There ye are... it's breathing steady as a winter's snow now. Shouldn't be any more trouble.~
@24558 = ~All right, then. I'll put it to the test soon enough.~
@24559 = ~I'll put it to the test soon enough, then.~
@24560 = ~Wait. Ye have something else o' mine, ye do. That sword ye're carrying, the one that looks like it's been dredged from Dinneshere. Where did ye come by it?~
@24561 = ~Aihonen's Blade? I got it from a fisherman in Easthaven.~
@24562 = ~Well, it wasn't meant for ye, it wasn't. Must have been some fool that gave it to ye. Its singing's off.~

@24564 = ~Aye, long ago I may have—for some poor fool that thought he'd take all o' Faerûn on his shoulders. Pah! That damn thing's singing is making me ears bleed! Hand it over!~
@24565 = ~Uh, all right.~
@24566 = ~Damnable metal... wail curses at *me*, will ye?! I'll fix ye! Not me fault yer master was a thrice-damned fool, not me fault he died... now, hold still, damn blade...~

@24568 = ~Ye be quiet! Give me a moment...~
@24569 = ~Last time I give a blade a woman's temperament—there, the lass is all better now, just needed a little comforting hand to smooth out the rough edges. Keep her close, an' she'll watch out for ye.~

@24577 = ~I know of a man who spent his life in search of one... and it ruined him. Perhaps it is not too late for him to find it, and his life, again.~
@24578 = ~Hmm. It'd be difficult... but a challenge, an' I'll not duck a challenge. Hand me the small block of ice from the bench, an' let yer eyes guide me hands...~
@24579 = ~~
@24580 = ~Hmph. Didn't know I had it in me. Here ye are, then. How does it look to ye?~
@24581 = ~It's beautiful, Tiernon. It was as if it grew from the ice as you carved it.~
@24582 = ~It will suffice. I'm sure the one I intend it for would accept anything vaguely shaped like a rose.~

@24613 = ~Ah... the shaper of ice, the child of the elder races. [Saddened]My fear whispered to me when he first came to these caves. 'Blind him,' it said. My spirit was weak, so fear ruled my actions.~ [SEER002]

The power of the Mirror of Black Ice lies in its ability to confound the sight of an attacker. Merely wearing it provides a boon to the wearer's defenses, as attackers will discover the wearer suddenly isn't where they thought he was when they first attacked. By concentrating on the mirror, however, the wearer may alter what others see when they look at him, distorting his image to make him harder to hit, or splitting his image into several reflections of himself, further confusing attackers. The mirror contains only a limited number amount of energy to perform these greater feats, but when the Blur and Mirror Image powers are gone, the passive defenses will remain.

This cloak is woven from the hair of virgins sent to the Burial Isle to sleep with their dead barbarian lords. It was the Seer's duty to comfort these women, to soothe their pain—in order to do so, she took a lock of hair from each and wove the strands into a cloak that would draw the spirits of fear from the virgins and steady their hearts. The result was a cloak that hangs heavy with guilt and does little to shield the wearer from the cold of the North. 

When worn, the hairs weave around the wielder's frame, the long strands lacing together like threads on a loom. The cloak will not willingly unravel itself from a wearer without being coerced by a Remove Curse spell.

The blade seems to draw its strength from Lac Dinneshere itself. As long as the wielder is within a dragon's flight of the lake (a considerable distance by most race's standards), the blade is a fearsome weapon.

If it can't reach the summoner it will fight its way towards <PRO_HIMHER>. This berserk elemental will also remain until slain, banished or the spell duration expires. This spell requires two rounds of concentration after the casting in order to implant control in the summoned creatures psyche. The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the cast for three rounds after being summoned. At the end of this time if the caster has won <PRO_HESHE> has control of the elemental, however if <PRO_HESHE> has lost the elemental goes berserk and tries to kill <PRO_HIMHER>. However, this does not prevent the use of other charm type spells cast afterwards if the contest was lost. It might be good to note that if charm spells are used before the contest is over they will have no effect on the outcome.~

This broad belt is made of tanned ogre hide and features five glass lozenges filled with black ogre blood. Caldinar used the belt frequently in his adventures. When he died, his practical comrades sold the belt in an auction.

A Sembian by birth, Ogi-Luc was a powerful man, as strong in body as he was in mind. However, Ogi-Luc wasn't content to merely be strong. He wanted to be exceptionally strong. When he put on these robes, proud men stood aside and braggarts stilled their tongues. For all of Ogi-Luc's pride and prowess, he was unable to defeat the Red Wizard abjurer Nesk Vhaltim. Nesk took the robes as a prize. They were later stolen and sold by a daring rogue.

The dagger he kept at his side was decorated with a ruby heart, and it became coveted by a small group of rivals in the great city. Fehll was eventually murdered at the hands of a seductress so clever that not even the prescient half-elf could see her malicious intent.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell works only on player characters or allied creatures. When cast, the target of this spell goes berserk, attacking the nearest creature until that creature is dead, then moving on to the next target. While under Blood Rage, the target is immune to charm, sleep, fear, hold, stunning, confusion, emotion, symbol spells, and related effects. In addition, the target gains +2 to hit, +3 to damage, +2 to Strength, +10 to maximum Hit Points, and +2 to <PRO_HISHER> movement rate. The spell has several disadvantages, however: The Hit Points of the target are masked for the duration of the spell, and the target cannot benefit from any effect that heals Hit Points. At the end of the spell's duration, the target becomes fatigued and <PRO_HISHER> Strength drops to 3 for 2 turns. Blood Rage cannot affect—and cannot be cast by—creatures of lawful alignment.~

@24824 = ~This area has seen much traffic recently. Giant-sized footprints are everywhere, trampling the snow down into a tightly packed sheet. In addition, human footprints are scattered about. It appears that at first the populace of the town tried to flee, but were captured and driven towards the southeastern section of town.~
@24825 = ~A large number of tracks are visible in the snow. The depth of the tracks combined with the angle of the steps indicates a dozen or more orcs are in the area. Wolves may be nearby as well. Amidst the smaller tracks are recent indentations that are much larger. Whatever made the recent tracks would have to be the size of an ogre. It also appears a cart was recently dragged through this small pass.~
@24826 = ~As might be expected, most of the tracks you find have been left by human adults and children. However, several tracks appear to be humanoid in nature, possibly left by goblins or orcs.~
@24827 = ~Conjure Lesser Air Elemental~
@24828 = ~A large number of tracks are visible in the snow. They seem to come from almost every direction, all converging on the distant community of Kuldahar. The tracks are mostly goblins, with a few orcs and a set of ogre prints moving towards the tower at the center of the pass. Recently, it appears the normally ordered war packs have disbanded and are wandering throughout the area.~
@24829 = ~Conjure Lesser Earth Elemental~
@24830 = ~Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental~
@24831 = ~Hundreds of tracks indicate the recent presence of a band of goblins in the area. Some of the tracks are staggered in a way that leads you to believe a battle recently took place here. It seems as though the goblins attacked a pack of giant insects. Judging from the depth of the tracks, the goblins were likely weak and starving at the time of their attack.~
@24832 = ~The smell of this chamber leads you to believe that it served as a lair for giant beetles.~
@24833 = ~Judging by the smell of humanoid waste and hair, it is likely that an ogre recently took up residence in this tower.~
@24834 = ~Humans were recently killed in this house, and goblins and orcs are likely to have spent a good deal of time here.~
@24835 = ~This area seems to be supernaturally warmed. There is nothing else that indicates why it should be in a state of summer when the rest of the pass is in the heart of winter. The trails and tracks of human residents are evident everywhere. Occasionally, you find a large green scale, possibly from an unusually large snake.~
@24836 = ~Even though this is obviously a house, there are no physical traces of habitation, nor are there tracks from a resident entering or exiting the building.~
@24837 = ~This valley is saturated with a supernatural aura. Though it appears to be capable of supporting wildlife, virtually none is present. Tracks indicate the presence of large, ape-like creatures. Thick, coarse white hair leads you to believe that the beasts are native to the area and may be camouflaged. Aside from your tracks, it seems as though one human traveler has been moving between Kuldahar and the Vale of Shadows on a regular basis. Judging from the shape and size of the tracks, the individual is a female human or half-elf. However, the depth of the tracks leads you to believe that the individual is traveling light, with little equipment or heavy clothing. This is noteworthy in that anyone traveling in this area without protection from the cold would be dead within hours.~

@24843 = ~Your tracking skills reveal little about this location. The only evidence of life in the area is a small portion of torn cloth near the entrance to the crypt. It appears to be made of fine, white fabric.~
@24844 = ~There are many tracks here, both coming and going. It appears as though several dozen creatures charged into the temple. The deepest prints come from trolls, probably two dozen or more. They led the pack in, and were followed by serpentine creatures and humans. The serpentine creatures seem to have melted some of the snow in their passing, and were probably magically protected against the environment. A large pack of humans or humanoids waited by the entrance and killed a number of giant humanoids who attempted to flee from the temple. The attackers who waited at the entrance were all barefoot and extremely light. Some tracks even appear to be skeletal, possibly a battalion of undead. After a few hours of fighting, it seems most of the attackers withdrew from the temple and went back the way they came, into the mountains.~
@24845 = ~There are many tracks here, both coming and going. It appears as though several dozen creatures charged into the temple. Battles raged between troll and serpentine attackers against the human and verbeeg residents. In many places, the presence of troll blood leads you to believe the defenders were able to down, but not kill, some of their troll attackers. Given time to regenerate, the trolls and their allies eventually smashed their way through the defenses and moved deeper into the compound.~
@24846 = ~A significant battle took place here between human and verbeeg defenders and a large number of troll and serpentine attackers. The battle did not last long.~
@24847 = ~There are many tracks here, both coming and going. Recently, a large number of trolls, large serpents, humans, and possibly undead left the area and returned a day later. You also see signs that lead you to believe that every few days, a small number of serpent creatures leave the area and move towards Kuldahar, later returning with humans.~
@24848 = ~Droppings on the floor indicate the presence of lizard men in the area. The warm temperature of the caverns would be a suitable environment for them, assuming they had enough food. Traces of unusually large webs and consistent waste lead you to believe that there may be unnaturally large spiders in the southern portions of the caves. Here and there, you also see bits of torn cloth and human hair.~
@24849 = ~The stench of this area is unmistakable. Trolls must reside in this cavern complex. In addition to the territorial claw marks on the walls and the all-too-abundant droppings, there are indications that giant insects might also live in the caves. Acid burns on the walls and floor might reveal the presence of bombardier beetles. You also believe a large number of humans recently moved through the area towards the southwest caves.~
@24850 = ~These caverns stink of decaying human flesh. There is little evidence of any life in this complex. However, it is obvious that a large number of corpses are nearby.~
@24851 = ~There is something odd about the nature of these worked caverns. Though there are signs of human residence, there is an unmistakable reptilian scent in the air, and you note several large green scales on the ground.~
@24852 = ~Large numbers of green scales can be found on the walls and floor of this level. In addition, there also seem to be some smaller scales of a sickly yellowish color. The scales smell horrible. Occasionally, you find extremely large, dark yellow iridescent scales, but you cannot place the creature. The scales smell of sulfur.~
@24853 = ~Refuse left on the floor combined with the stench of body odor indicates the presence of goblinoids, probably orcs, in the caverns. Given the nature of orcs, they likely have spread throughout the caves, the most powerful residing in the central chamber. Trails of mud and water mark where objects were dragged across the cavern floor from the outside.~
@24854 = ~The tracks of many large orcs can be seen going into and out of this area. Their stance, stride, and angle indicate that they must be orcs, but they are far larger than any orc tracks you have ever seen. Scattered here and there in the snow, you also find narrow tracks that are, in all likelihood, elven. There are, perhaps, a dozen in total.~
@24855 = ~There are few tracks visible in this area, as the floor is mostly stone. However, you do detect an overwhelming fungoid smell. In addition, some of the mushroom stalks in this area appear to have been knocked aside by some giant humanoid creatures.~
@24856 = ~Telltale territorial markings on the walls indicate the presence of an umber hulk or a hook horror in the area. The smell of offal tips you off to the likely presence of orogs to the south.~
@24857 = ~There are signs of human life in this area, but nothing else.~
@24858 = ~There seems to be a lot of traffic through this pass. Serpentine creatures of great heat have melted the snow near the eastern cave entrance, and a variety of monstrous creatures have traveled through the area in every direction.~
@24859 = ~In the frost on the ground, you can discern that humans have recently hurried out of the area, while cold serpentine creatures still reside here.~
@24860 = ~Giant-sized humanoid tracks likely indicate the presence of frost giants. In addition, wolf prints and coarse white hair lead you to believe small packs of winter wolves may be moving through the area. Humanoid footprints of various sorts are all over the area.~
@24861 = ~The most common tracks in this area are the distinctive footprints of snow trolls and their cousins, ice trolls. The distinctive coarse white hair and tracks of yeti can also be seen in some areas, as can the occasional serpentine tracks of some cold-resistant creature.~
@24862 = ~The smell of burned hair and flesh in this area leads you to believe humanoids or animals have been burned here recently. In addition, the smell of sulfur is overpowering. Whatever lives in this area must be resistant to the heat and fumes.~
@24863 = ~There are traces of subterranean humanoid life in this area, possibly dwarves or gnomes. Huge scratches on many of the walls indicate umber hulks have been through this cavern complex before. Other gigantic scratches on the stone indicate the presence of some other sort of giant creature, perhaps a huge insect of some sort.~
@24864 = ~This area is obviously home to many deep gnomes and at least a few transient members of other humanoid races.~
@24865 = ~There are few tracks in this area. The only signs of life appear to have come from a single elven traveler, probably female, definitely heavily armed and armored. She left a few days after she arrived and was carrying far more out than she brought in.~
@24866 = ~The smell of burned hair and flesh in this area leads you to believe that humanoids or animals have been burned here recently. In addition, the smell of sulfur is overpowering. Whatever lives in this area must be resistant to the heat and fumes.~
@24867 = ~Marks on the wall are the telltale territorial markings of a large number of umber hulks. In addition, there is a strange smell of offal in the air. It seems to be both human and animal. It might come from some sort of hybrid monster.~

A sunfire is like a fireball—an explosive burst of flame that delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it. Sunfire deals 1d6 points of fire damage for each caster level, up to a maximum of 15d6. The wizard gestures with <PRO_HISHER> hand and the entire area around <PRO_HIMHER> erupts in flames, striking all except for the caster. Creatures failing their Saves vs. Spell suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage.~

@25219 = ~JESTER: This Bard is well versed in the arts of ridicule and hilarity, and uses <PRO_HISHER> abilities to distract and confuse <PRO_HISHER> enemies, cavorting madly during combat. Do not mistake <PRO_HIMHER> for a true fool, however, as <PRO_HESHE> can also be quite deadly.

The weapon sets the number of attacks of the Cleric to 3. It lasts for 1 round per level of the caster. When equipped, the wielder cannot cast further spells.

Disadvantages:
– Alignment restricted to lawful good, lawful neutral, lawful evil, and true neutral.~

@25224 = ~TOTEMIC DRUID: This Druid closely identifies with a particular animal, an animal that <PRO_HESHE> feels represents <PRO_HISHER> spirit. This grants <PRO_HIMHER> a special connection to the animal kingdom, and <PRO_HESHE> is able to call upon their spirits to aid <PRO_HIMHER>.

Advantages:

Disadvantages:
– Cannot Shapeshift.~
@25225 = ~SHAPESHIFTER: This Druid is not called Shapeshifter because <PRO_HESHE> has access to a great variety of forms, but rather because of <PRO_HISHER> complete dedication to a single alternate form. This Druid has willingly allowed <PRO_HIMHER>self to become infected with lycanthropy, but due to intense study and training <PRO_HESHE> has the ability to control <PRO_HISHER> affliction. The creature <PRO_HESHE> becomes is that of the werewolf, the most famous of the lycanthrope shape changers.

@25226 = ~~
@25227 = ~AVENGER: A member of a special sect within the druidic order, a Druid of this type is dedicated to fighting those who would defile nature.

Advantages:
– May Shapeshift into the form of a sword spider, baby wyvern, and lesser fire salamander besides the normal shapeshifting abilities.
– Six mage spells are added to <PRO_HISHER> repertoire, all the way up to the 6th level. These are listed below:

@25428 = ~We confronted Baldemar about the assassin Wylfdene claimed was sent by the Ten Towns. After some prodding, he finally admitted that there had indeed been a secret plot to kill the barbarian leader. He claimed to have been coerced by other council members into participating in the dastardly scheme. We gave him a brief lecture on the virtues of honesty and principle. He seemed moved by our words and announced his intentions to report the incident to the council.~
@25429 = ~We spoke with the fallen ranger, Emmerich Hawk. He told us of his encounter in the forest with a great white wolf and how he believes the Forest Father is punishing him for his shortcomings. Apparently, he feels that his failure to stop the three brothers in town from over-trapping has somehow angered the god of nature.~
@25430 = ~Emmerich told us that there is a strong possibility that the barbarians have set up camp to the east of Lonelywood, in the rocky foothills of a place called Bremen's Run. Based on his directions, we should be able to find our way there.~
@25431 = ~We spoke with Emmerich about Digby's untimely demise. He seems to believe that Digby was killed by the same great white wolf that attacked him in the forest.~
@25432 = ~We had a conversation with Arden Thurlow, the wife of Baldemar Thurlow, and brought up the subject of the Ten Towns representative that came to visit Baldemar. Arden mentioned the man only stayed for one night and spoke only with Baldemar, so she has no idea what they discussed while he was here.~

@25466 = ~I see. Well, it certainly is reassuring to have a brave band of adventurers such as yourselves in town. If those hairy brutes do decide to attack Lonelywood, we'll need every sword we can get to aid in the defense.~
@25467 = ~You've been informed correctly. I am the town's duly elected representative to the council. Why do you ask?~
@25468 = ~I can tell you the situation is grim. The barbarians have raised an army and are marching against the Ten Towns. Our town is cut off from aid, and we can expect no reinforcements in the near future.~
@25469 = ~Camp, you say? Hmm... I'm afraid I don't know anything about that.~
@25470 = ~I admire your courage, but there really is no need for you to risk your lives by getting involved. I assure you... the council is doing everything it can to prevent this war.~
@25471 = ~The council has dispatched an... uh... a delegate to meet with the barbarian king. I'm sure he is well on his way to negotiating a peaceful settlement to this conflict.~
@25472 = ~Why, yes. As a matter of fact, he was. He stopped here in Lonelywood on his way to the barbarian camp. As the town representative, I thought it my duty to aid his mission by providing food and lodging.~
@25473 = ~That's a good question. To be honest, I haven't the slightest clue how he made it through. He arrived alone, though. Perhaps he managed to slip past the barbarians undetected.~

@25504 = ~I was instructed to return to home at once and not to say a word to anyone about the plot. They said that they would handle the hiring of the assassin, and that I need only to act as the killer's contact in Lonelywood.~
@25505 = ~Several nights later, the one-eyed stranger showed up at my door. He said only that he was sent by the council, and that he was in need of lodging.~
@25506 = ~I was terrified that someone would see us together, so I invited him in. He seemed a decent enough fellow. We spoke a great deal that night—mostly about politics in the Dale, for I was too fearful to bring up the topic of the assassination plot. The next morning, he left for the camp, and I never saw him again.~
@25507 = ~That's all I know. You've got to believe me... I didn't want to have any part of this assassination business, but I had no choice. The others would have ruined me if I opposed them.~
@25508 = ~I suppose you're right. I've acted like a selfish coward. I should've exposed this treachery before the council when I had the chance.~
@25509 = ~You've got a point. I *am* still a council representative. And as such, I believe it is my duty to report this matter before the entire council at our next meeting. Thank you for making that clear to me.~
@25510 = ~I've told you the truth! I swear on my mother's grave!~
@25511 = ~Murders? Oh, you mean the animal attacks. Poor Digby and Dolan. It does seem a bit odd that they would both meet their ends in the same manner—and so close to one another. Oh well... I'm sure Emmerich has the matter well in hand.~
@25512 = ~Yes, it was Digby I believe... or was it Doogal? I can't remember. In any case, I heard he was set upon by some wild beast. A wolf, no doubt. I shall have to talk to Emmerich about it.~

@25543 = ~We heard you had a guest several nights ago. Was this one-eyed stranger the council delegate you speak of?~
@25544 = ~We've been to the barbarian camp. We know this "delegate" was an assassin that was hired by the council.~

@25561 = ~~
@25562 = ~Drop the act, Baldemar. We know you're involved in this.~
@25563 = ~Wylfdene had the one-eyed delegate executed. Before he died, he confessed to being a hired assassin.~
@25564 = ~Then why send a delegate to negotiate peace? No, I believe Wylfdene was telling the truth.~
@25565 = ~I trust no one... least of all shifty bureaucrats that hide behind assassins.~
@25566 = ~Perhaps you're right. Let me ask you about something else.~
@25567 = ~We'll see. After we've dealt with the barbarian threat, I intend to bring this matter before the council.~
@25568 = ~Look, you spineless worm... you'll tell us what we want to know, or I'll cut out your lying tongue and beat you to death with it.~
@25569 = ~You're right... we can't prove it. But from now on we'll be keeping a close eye on you. Farewell.~
@25570 = ~Go on. We're listening.~
@25571 = ~We believe you, Baldemar. However, you are not entirely blameless. You should've had the courage to stand up for what is right... even if it cost you your seat on the council.~
@25572 = ~All right, we'll let you off the hook this time. But if we find out you've lied to us again...~
@25573 = ~Not only are you a poor liar, you're a weak and pathetic excuse for a man. Now, get out of my sight!~
@25574 = ~It's not too late to do the right thing. You are, after all, still this town's duly elected representative to the council.~
@25575 = ~Maybe next time you'll know better. Farewell.~
@25576 = ~You're welcome, Baldemar. Farewell.~

who knows what this spells does~

@25625 = ~ 'Tis no rumor. There have been numerous reports of a huge army of tribesmen moving southward into the Dale. I assure you, the threat the barbarians pose to Lonelywood and the rest of the towns is *very* real.~
@25626 = ~The barbarians have long been at odds with the Ten Towns, since the first settlers arrived in the Dale. The events of late are simply a prelude to another bloody chapter in the history of Icewind Dale.~
@25627 = ~If the barbarians set their gaze upon this town, I fear there is little we could do to stop them. When and if the attack comes, we'll fight till the end. However, with the mere handful of swords we can muster... it'll be like attempting to halt an avalanche with a whisper.~
@25628 = ~Lonelywood is far too remote and insignificant a community to warrant the protection of the larger towns. No, if war comes, they'll scurry to the safety of their own walls and watch as the barbarians burn Lonelywood to the ground.~
@25629 = ~There isn't much to tell, really. Lonelywood is the northernmost of the Ten Towns. It is also one of the smallest settlements in the Dale. The folk that live here are mostly common tradesmen seeking to earn a living away from the fierce competition between the larger towns.~
@25630 = ~Ah, yes. It seems that Digby, one of three brothers that live together here in town, finally got himself killed. Apparently, he was savaged by a wolf while setting traps in the forest. Rather ironic, isn't it?~
@25631 = ~As a matter of fact, there is. A couple of local trappers, brothers actually, both managed to get killed by some rabid wolf lurking on the outskirts of town. Other than that, I'd say 'tis business as usual around here.~
@25632 = ~Strange, isn't it? What's even more peculiar is that they were killed on separate occasions. First Digby, then Dolan.~
@25633 = ~True Sight~
@25634 = ~As a matter of fact, there is. Three local trappers, brothers actually, all managed to get killed by some rabid wolf lurking on the outskirts of town. Other than that, I'd say 'tis business as usual around here.~
@25635 = ~Strange, isn't it? What's even more peculiar is that they were all killed on separate occasions. First Digby, then Dolan, and finally Doogal.~
@25636 = ~Quinn Silverfinger tends a shrine to Waukeen just across the lane from here. I'm sure the halfling gentleman would be eager to aid you in any way he can.~
@25637 = ~Ah ha! A stalwart troupe of courageous adventurers on a quest for honor and glory! I was once like you... full of fire and spirit. These days, I'm content to simply be full of drink.~

@25642 = ~There once was a time, many years ago,
When my heart, like a smith's forge, was aglow
With the brightly burning flames of passion.
I was a bard, and, as was the fashion,
I traveled the land, stopping each night
To perform for kind hosts who would invite
A wandering minstrel in for a meal.
Each ballad I sang did always appeal
To both nobility and commoner;
For I did sing of virtue and honor,~
@25643 = ~There are no blacksmiths in town, but Emmerich may be able to furnish you with weapons and equipment. He's a bowyer by trade. His cabin is in the southeastern corner of town.~

@25674 = ~We don't mind. Please, tell us your tale.~

@25819 = ~A beautiful weapon with a mocking name, Pig's Eye is an elven blade dedicated to the slaying of orcs. Although its proper name is Gruumshacan, most people who know of the blade refer to it as Pig's Eye. The name is an allusion to the fateful blow which Corellon Larethian, patron of the elven race, inflicted upon Gruumsh, head of the orc pantheon. The glass-encased orc eye that rests in the hilt makes it easy to recognize.

The blade was crafted in 239 DR by an elven enchanter and weaponsmith named Shenarr Caith. After he had finished imbuing the weapon with its power, he gave it to his cousin, the ranger Velaic Caith, who put it to extensive use against orcs near Cormanthyr. His son, Tredain, and his grandson, Galesic, also employed the blade for hundreds of years without misfortune. Eventually, the Caith family decided to make the long migration to Evermeet. As Gruumshacan was not the family's moonblade, the Caiths decided to trade the weapon for some of the funds necessary to transform their ancient uncle Shenarr into a baelnorn. The last recorded remarks from Shenarr indicate that he was more than slightly amused at how the little blade had helped him defy death.

When this spell is cast at a creature, it breaches and dispels all of the specific protections on a target creature. Here is a complete list of all the spells that are dispelled by breach: shield, protection circle, resist fear, protection from fire/cold, fireshield, protection from acid, protection from electricity, protection from magic energy, protection from the elements, and protection from energy. The target's Magic Resistance, if it has any, does not affect this spell. Is this rebounded by spell turning spells??????~

When cast at a point designated by the wizard this spell will cancel all illusion/phantasm spells of 5th level and lower in the area. The spells that are affected by this are reflected image, invisibility, mirror image, non-detection, improved invisibility, and shadow door. It is important to note that this spell Indiscriminately dispels illusion/phantasm spells of 5th level and lower so this includes the caster and any friendly creatures in the area as well as enemies. The area of effect is roughly a 20-ft. radius around the target. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell.~

When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects. The first is that the creature's Magic Resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster. The second is that it will cancel one spell protection of 6th level and lower on creature. For example, if this spell was cast by a 15th-level wizard the target creature would lose 25% magic resistance from <PRO_HISHER> current total reducing it to 0 if less than that remains as well as canceling one 6th level or lower spell protection. The list of spells that this includes is minor spell deflection, minor spell turning, spell deflection, minor globe of invulnerability, spell immunity and globe of invulnerability. Magic Resistance does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections. The resistance remains lowered for 1 round per level of the caster.~

This spell releases a burst of electrical energy at a target; unlike the Lightning Bolt spell, however, once the bolt strikes the initial target, the electricity then jumps to the next nearest creature (friend or foe), losing a small amount of energy with each additional strike until it is expended. The bolt initially inflicts 1d6 Hit Points of electrical damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 12d6 points of damage. Each jump the bolt makes reduces the damage by 1d6. Each creature that is hit is allowed a Save vs. Spell for half damage.~

@26473 = ~*sigh* Why must they always be so difficult?~

@26476 = ~You're wasting your time, Vaarglan. It's obvious these buffoons know nothing of Alacander. I say we burn down this pathetic excuse for a town and slaughter its inhabitants. If the traitor *is* here, such a display would surely draw him out.~

@26568 = ~Of fortune, glory, and other such things
That strike the fancies of peasants and kings.
Far and wide, throughout the realms I did roam;
Song was my life, and the road was my home.
Until one day, as I happened by chance,
To be entertaining, with song and dance,
A crowd of children from a nearby town,
When along came a servant of the crown.
A loyal steward of Auckney was he;
In his hands he bore a royal decree~
@26569 = ~From which he read with a baritone voice:
Hear ye, hear ye, let the kingdom rejoice!
The princess of Auckney shall soon be wed
To the king's magistrate, Lord Hugh the Red.
His Majesty does graciously extend
An invitation for all to attend
Tonight's festivities at the castle,
To honor his most worthy vassal.
For the rest of his words, I did not wait.
Like an arrow, I shot straight for the gate~
@26570 = ~Bits of fur and blood from a variety of forest animals are scattered around this room.~

@26573 = ~The tracks of dozens of barbarian warriors litter the room. One set stands out among the others. Large and deep, the barbarian who made this set of tracks must be over seven feet tall and weigh over three hundred pounds.~
@26574 = ~In the soft grass and snow of this area, you find three types of tracks. One set of tracks walks along the southern shore, and probably belongs to a slow moving human man. The other two types of tracks have been made by huge, stumbling men, easily weighing over five hundred pounds, and extremely lightweight men who appear to be moving at an incredible pace. There is no order to the latter two types of tracks.~
@26575 = ~You gave Murdaugh a Glacier Rose.~
@26576 = ~~
@26577 = ~The stone of this area makes it difficult to find tracks, but you do find trails of water left by bloated feet, wandering aimlessly throughout the barrows.~
@26578 = ~A cornucopia of beasts have taken up residence in the exterior of this glacier. You find white fur from three different types of creatures: yetis, polar bears, and winter wolves. Amid their plentiful tracks, you also discern the loping gait and distinctive footprints of trolls. The undulating pattern of scale imprints indicates the presence of frost salamanders. Gigantic, heavy footprints likely point to a small group of frost giants. You also find two sets of dwarf footprints. Judging by their irregular footsteps and frequent stops, they probably were freezing to death.~
@26579 = ~There is one type of creature living in these tunnels: polar worms. The unnaturally smooth ice walls could only have been created by their giant, incredibly hot bodies.~
@26580 = ~Though these caverns have obviously been created by the deadly hot bodies of polar worms, there is no indication that anything living has been here in a long time.~
@26581 = ~Your tracking skills do not reveal any tracks in the area, but you do detect the faint smell of an odd spice.~
@26582 = ~Trolls patrol this region ferociously. You also note droppings that are curiously similar to wyvern dung.~
@26583 = ~Three different types of troll tracks cover the caverns of this iceberg. Occasionally, you also see patterns of skeletal footprints and dung from some sort of wyvern-like creature.~
@26584 = ~These deep caverns of the iceberg reek of death and decay. On the frost-covered ground, you can make out footprints of marine creatures, possibly sahuagin. There are a great number of them in these caverns. Although you cannot find any other types of tracks, you feel an evil chill in the air. It feels like the cold of death.~
@26585 = ~You protected Kieran from the Host Tower assassins.~

@26587 = ~[Movie]Heart of Winter Intro~

@26590 = ~Of the king's castle, where I did present
My skills as a bard for the night's event.
The king was kind, I'm pleased to report,
For he welcomed me into his court,
And treated me as an honored guest;
In return, I did promise him my best,
And even offered to compose a tune
So lovely it would make his subjects swoon.
Indeed, that night, I did keep to my word
And sang such a ballad that none had heard;~
@26591 = ~It was a rousing tale of blood and gold,
Of heroes, villains, and kingdoms of old.
But as I performed, my eyes did meet
The gaze of an angel, lovely and sweet.
'Twas the young princess that captured my heart,
And for her I sang with all of my art,
Pouring my soul out with each ringing note
Until no more sound would come from my throat.
And when at last my performance did end,
The king himself was the first to commend~
@26592 = ~Such a fine display of lyrical skill.
He offered gold as a sign of goodwill,
And he further insisted that I stay
As an honored guest until the day
His beloved daughter was to be wed,
To his chief magistrate, Lord Hugh the Red.
I humbly agreed, though I did not know
How strong my love for the princess would grow.
For each passing day was spent at her side,
And often, upon horseback, we did ride~
@26593 = ~Out into the forests, near Castle Auck,
Where I would play music and she would talk
Of her betrothal to Lord Hugh the Red,
And how she wished she were free instead
To follow her heart and marry for love.
Oh, how I prayed to the heavens above
For the chance to make the princess my own,
But Tymora's dice had already been thrown.
As I pined in vain, the nights quickly passed,
And the day of the wedding came at last,~
@26594 = ~But before the groom could offer his ring,
The princess bride declared to the king
That she loved another and could not bear
To marry the magistrate and forswear
Her one true love; at which point she did turn,
And spoke the words for which my heart did yearn:
I love thee, Murdaugh, and were it my say,
I would gladly marry you on this day.
Upon hearing her words, the groom went pale.
He turned to the king and started to rail;~
@26595 = ~On about law and tradition he went,
Begging His Majesty not to consent,
For the princess was of the noble line
And could not be wed to some lowborn swine.
The king was torn, for his daughter was dear,
But the laws of the kingdom were quite clear;
So in silence he stood, shaking his head,
Until at last it was Lord Hugh the Red
Who proposed a solution—nay, a scheme,
Which, at that moment in time it did seem~
@26596 = ~To be a fair and noble compromise,
For which I thought him to be very wise.
He pointed out that it was the king's right
By law to bestow the title of knight
Upon any man who succeeds in a quest.
In addition, he did further suggest,
That because I was not of noble birth,
There was but one way to prove my worth:
Journey to the north, where the icewind blows;
There you must find the fabled Glacier Rose.~
@26597 = ~The king did heed his magistrate's advice
And bade me quest for this rose made of ice,
And decreed to all that, should I succeed,
The hand of the princess he would concede.
So, with hope in my heart, I sallied forth
And began my journey through the frozen north;
For three years I did search, both high and low,
Across seas of ice and mountains of snow;
I visited all ten towns of Icewind Dale,
But alas, it seems, I was destined to fail.~
@26598 = ~After four long years, I gave up my search
And traded my quest for this lonely perch,
For it was here upon this very stool
That I realized I'd been played for a fool.
For as surely as the icewind blows,
There is no such thing as a Glacier Rose.~
@26599 = ~What? How can this be? Surely this is some kind of trick... an illusion, perhaps?~
@26600 = ~It *is* real! After all these years... at last I have found a Glacier Rose! Now I can return to Auckney and marry my true love, the Princess. Thank you, my friends. I am, and forever shall be, in your debt.~
@26601 = ~Yes, go ahead and mock my pain. I do not blame you. True love, quests, roses of ice... I was a fool to believe in such fairy tale nonsense.~
@26602 = ~Ah, my friends. It is good to see you again. I am all packed for my return to Auckney. Once the road is safe to travel, I'll be on my way back to my beautiful princess. What say we have a drink to celebrate?~
@26603 = ~Ah, but there is. I just happened to have one right here.~
@26604 = ~*snore* Huh? Sorry, I must have dozed off.~
@26605 = ~That is the most depressing thing I've ever heard. You *are* pathetic.~

Heaven above, Earth and Sea below
Sun's flight, Day turns to Night
Seasons change all that we know
Stones numbered five bring the gate alive
To home the passage will flow

From what I can garner from this, five gems are needed to activate the device. Each gem represents one of the five aspects of the gate: Heaven, Day, Earth, Sea, and Night. Only by placing the correct gem, at the appropriate point, will the portal open. 

Now, this all seems rather straightforward, and that is exactly what worries me. It is not the Master's way to be so forthcoming with information. It is my belief that the gems, whatever they may be, must be changed somehow. That would explain the line about the seasons. I must think about this some more..."~

They wailed and sighed
Then they died
From the grave I've had my kiss
Bring me now the lover's gift

@27046 = ~Retired warrior?~
@27047 = ~We met a jackal warrior in the catacombs named Rikasha. He seemed genuinely friendly and answered any questions put to him.~
@27048 = ~Yes. I grow old, and I tire of the violence and bloodshed. I desire peace for my remaining years.~
@27049 = ~You mentioned the Jackals. Who are they?~
@27050 = ~"Jackal" is what my people call themselves. We are born as jackals but later in life we can assume a warrior and a human form. You see me now in my warrior form.~
@27051 = ~I've heard of your race. I believe you're called jackalweres.~
@27052 = ~You're a race of lycanthropes?~
@27053 = ~We prefer the term "Jackal." We are not were-creatures.~
@27054 = ~So, you could change to a human or a jackal right now if you wanted to?~

@27070 = ~What can you tell me about Hobart?~
@27071 = ~We asked Rikasha about the halfling, Hobart. He says that Hobart is a lackey of the Luremaster and not to be trusted.~
@27072 = ~~
@27073 = ~He came here many years ago. He sought a way out but could not find it. In the end, he became the master's lackey and now enjoys a limited freedom. I would not put my trust in the little one.~
@27074 = ~What can you tell me about the master?~
@27075 = ~~
@27076 = ~Only this. His rule here is absolute. We are all his prisoners, his slaves, or his servants. It just depends on your point of view.~
@27077 = ~We asked Rikasha about the Luremaster, but he had no useful information. He would only say that the Luremaster is the absolute ruler here and that all other creatures were his slaves.~

@27082 = ~And what is your point of view, Rikasha?~
@27083 = ~In my youth, I was his servant. I knew no better than to serve him. In my prime, I was his slave. I knew better, but could not defy him. Now, in my fading years, I am his prisoner. I will no longer serve, but I cannot claim my freedom...~

@27089 = ~Perhaps... If the portal could be opened...~
@27090 = ~There is a portal here? How is that possible?~
@27091 = ~There was a time when my people lived upon the surface of the world. One day, the sky rained fire and the earth split asunder. Our city was ravaged, and parts of it sank beneath the earth. What few of us survived found ourselves trapped here.~
@27092 = ~~
@27093 = ~There are words scratched into the rust of the pipe. The handwriting looks like that of a child:

Smell of dog
Skin of lizard
To find the staff
Kill the wizard

This is a truly a terrible verse. It must have been written by either a horrendous poet or a madman.~
@27094 = ~As you place the staff into the pipe, the water briefly takes on a greenish glow.~
@27095 = ~We explored every inch of these caverns, but no path led back to the surface. We then tried to tunnel our way out, but the rock above had fused into a solid mass. Out of desperation, we decided to build a portal.~
@27096 = ~~
@27097 = ~Ransom Note~
@27098 = ~There are words scratched into the rust of the pipe. The handwriting looks like that of a child:

Vallah is no more
But he has left a thing behind
Give me a hand
And I shall help you in return

You wonder why someone would write such things on pipes.~
@27099 = ~Ransom Note~
@27100 = ~It was to be a simple device, capable of just reaching the surface above. With such a short range, the power requirements would be minimal. It took years, but we managed to do it. Unfortunately, it was our undoing...~
@27101 = ~Oh? What happened?~
@27102 = ~During our absence, humans had settled our lands and built the keep above. The portal opened into their inner sanctum. When my people stepped through, the humans mistook us for invaders. A terrible battle raged, and we were driven back through the portal.~
@27103 = ~I see. What happened next?~
@27104 = ~The humans pursued us as we fled and nearly decimated us. Satisfied that we were no longer a threat, they then dismantled the portal...~
@27105 = ~Wait. They dismantled the portal?~
@27106 = ~Yes, but hear me out... Years later, the master of the keep arrived. He studied the portal for some time and managed to reactivate it. Afterwards, he removed certain key components and scattered them throughout the caverns...~
@27107 = ~As you place the desiccated hand into the pipe, the fingers curl into a fist.~
@27108 = ~Do you know what these components are?~
@27109 = ~I'm sorry, but no. These events took place long before my lifetime. Perhaps a shaman of my people knows... but they would not reveal such secrets.~
@27110 = ~Where can I find a shaman?~
@27111 = ~There are words scratched into the rust of the pipe. The handwriting looks like that of a child:

No sacrifice will do
But the blood of a friend true.
But guilt will leave its stain
If you wish to have the blade.

This verse sounds like the ravings of a madman.~
@27112 = ~Return from whence you came. Seek the room with the standing stones. It is there that they reside. Be warned, however: They will not welcome you as I have done.~
@27113 = ~One last question, Rikasha. Where can the portal be found?~
@27114 = ~We asked Rikasha if he knew of a way out of the catacombs. He told us of a portal located within a temple on a lake here. The portal opens into the keep above, most likely the inner sanctum. Unfortunately, the Luremaster has disabled the portal by removing key components and scattering them throughout the catacombs. We need to discover what these components are. Rikasha believes a shaman of his people may possess this knowledge but would be unwilling to share it. The shamans reside in a room with standing stones. Perhaps we can find a clue to this puzzle there.~
@27115 = ~Continue along this passage and seek the temple of the lake. The portal lies within.~
@27116 = ~~
@27117 = ~If you so desire, then feel free. I will see that you are not disturbed.~
@27118 = ~I am grateful.~
@27119 = ~Rikasha greets you again. How may he serve you?~
@27120 = ~Who are you again?~

@27134 = ~Don't you have enough to do in the rest of this gods-forsaken place than pester me?~
@27135 = ~Heh. So you met the Luremaster, eh? Watch out for him. He's craftier than a fox in winter.~
@27136 = ~About the Luremaster? Well, I... I don't really know any more than you do. I just see him floating around the gate. Uh... other adventurers have told me his name. That's all.~
@27137 = ~Yeah, get on with it. At my age, you learn not to waste time with chit-chat.~
@27138 = ~This? It's my humble refuge from the sand and sun. I've collected a few bits and pieces of treasure from the ruins over time. Most of it's junk, but at least it occupies my time.~
@27139 = ~Eh... like you, I heard about it from someone else who came here. I've been trying to get at the treasure inside for quite a while now. I'm just one old halfling, though. Heh heh. What can I do against a ghost, hmm?~
@27140 = ~Sure, why not? It's not like any of this junk has sentimental value. Let me see what you have.~
@27141 = ~Heh heh. Amazing. You actually managed to get into the keep. You're the first. Maybe the Luremaster was right about you aft—oops. I mean... uh... heh heh.~
@27142 = ~Uh... I meant that... ugh. *gulp*~
@27143 = ~Please... please don't make me tell you. H-he can hear us. *gulp* He'll kill me if I tell you. Kill me!~
@27144 = ~Look, I'm stuck here, just like you. I'm sorry I wasn't entirely truthful when we met... I hope you don't die like all the others. Oh! I've said too much. Please don't ask me any more!~
@27145 = ~As you pour the blood of Quallo's friend, the carrion crawler, into the pipe, the water turns crimson and a strange halo surrounds all of the pipes. From the filthy water, a sword rises to hover before you. As you grasp the hilt, a scream echoes through the sewers.~
@27146 = ~Well, since you put it that way... I know who the Luremaster is. I know all too well. I have been his guest for decades now. At least, I think it's been decades. Let me back up a bit and explain things.~
@27147 = ~I used to be an adventurer, just like you. Back then, I had a few less inches on my belly and a few more hairs on my foolish head. My companions wanted to explore the Battle of the Bones, south of Evereska. Well, I was interested in something else, a castle called Maluradek.~
@27148 = ~Yes, this very castle. It was as ruined then as it is now. The desert expanded, swallowing it up over a century ago. I got in easy enough. It was getting out that proved hard.~
@27149 = ~While I was searching for a way to get into the keep, the Luremaster appeared to me in all his ghostly glory. He spoke in his usual cryptic manner, presenting me with his "heroes challenge."~
@27150 = ~What did I do? I tucked tail and ran. Without looking back, I scaled down the outer wall from the east parapets. When I turned around to walk across the desert, I found myself back in the courtyard. No matter how I tried to climb, jump, or dig my way out of this damned castle, I wound up getting nowhere.~
@27151 = ~After days of hard work without food or water, I was seeing things. I must have passed out and started to dream. That's when I saw the Luremaster again. He asked me once again to take up his challenge. I told him that I had just come searching for some treasure. He had no pity for little old me.~
@27152 = ~He told me that only true heroes could leave the castle, and that, since I was obviously lacking in that department, I would have to serve him if I wanted to stay alive. He handed me a ring and told me it would transport me wherever I wanted for up to a day. By dawn, I would always appear back in the courtyard. In return, I was to find adventurers worthy of taking up his challenge.~
@27153 = ~Aye. And I would gladly give all the gold I've ever seen in my lifetime to have kept it just a dream. But when I woke, I found this damned ring on my finger. If I take it off, I'll die. I've been serving him ever since.~
@27154 = ~I'm sorry I was unpleasant to you when we met. I try not to get too attached to those I'm forced to bring here. You understand, right?~
@27155 = ~Over the years, there have been hundreds. You're the first to open the gates to the keep, though. *sigh* I hope you can lift the curse from this damned place.~
@27156 = ~Well, I'm no coward, but then again I'm no orc-wit either. I don't know how it is where you come from, but where I'm from, a halfling would have to have raisins in his braincase to traffic with spirits.~
@27157 = ~Hobart, what do you know about the strange ghost that lurks near the north gate?~
@27158 = ~Irritated by Glass Dust~
@27159 = ~Could I look at some of the things you've found? Would you be interested in trading?~
@27160 = ~~
@27161 = ~How did you find this place, Hobart?~
@27162 = ~Sorry to bother you, Hobart. Farewell.~
@27163 = ~~
@27164 = ~What do you know about him?~
@27165 = ~~

@27177 = ~~
@27178 = ~Wait a moment... what did the Luremaster tell you about us?~
@27179 = ~Hobart, what are you hiding?~
@27180 = ~Listen to me, Hobart, you better start telling us what you know or we might have to get "rough."~
@27181 = ~I didn't realize... don't worry, we won't force you to tell us anything.~
@27182 = ~Can you at least give us some idea of what's going on here?~
@27183 = ~Hobart, I can command the forces of hell with a word. Do you think that the Luremaster scares me in the slightest? Tell... me... now.~
@27184 = ~Hobart, I can level towns with a word. Do you think that the Luremaster scares me in the slightest? Tell... me... now.~
@27185 = ~You will tell me now or you will die now. It's that simple.~
@27186 = ~I understand, Hobart. Can I see what you have to trade?~
@27187 = ~You little bastard. Tell me everything you know before I beat you to a pulp.~
@27188 = ~I've heard enough. Farewell, Hobart.~
@27189 = ~Go on.~
@27190 = ~~
@27191 = ~How so?~
@27192 = ~This castle?~
@27193 = ~~
@27194 = ~~
@27195 = ~There is nothing else to do with this pipe.~
@27196 = ~~
@27197 = ~~
@27198 = ~Other than the creature that bit you, there is nothing else of interest in this pool.~
@27199 = ~~
@27200 = ~That's it?~
@27201 = ~~
@27202 = ~What did he do?~
@27203 = ~~
@27204 = ~The two skeletons lie entwined in each others arms, an eternal embrace. One of the skeletons is slightly smaller than the other. On its bony finger, there is a golden ring. You could remove it if you wish to.~
@27205 = ~I thought you said it was just a dream.~
@27206 = ~We spoke with a strange spirit near the entrance to the castle keep. The spirit informed us that there is but one way to leave these ruins alive. Apparently, we must prove to him that we are worthy of bearing the mantle of heroes, whatever that means. The only clue he was willing to offer was a riddle.
 
North, east, south, and west,
In towers four the purgatives rest.
Feed them where the spirits nest,
Or forever here remain, our guest.
The sun rises, the earth warms,
Four men lie cold, yet no one mourns.
"Leave them be!" the mad lord warns,
And from my work their praise is shorn.

He told us to return once the task is complete, and we would be admitted inside the castle's keep.~
@27207 = ~Blood of Quallo's Friend~
@27208 = ~Upon entering the keep, we were visited once more by the haunting spirit called the Luremaster. It would seem that he has some tale he wants to share with us, but, rather than just tell us straight out, he wants us to discover it for ourselves. Again, the only clue he offered was a riddle.

To understand this shameful tale,
Through princely guards you must prevail.
'Neath unused arms and unstruck mail
Will you find the coffin's nail.
'Round and 'round the sun does fly,
And one man left below will die.
His crime? To make the peasant's eye
Reflect his lord's ignoble lie.~
@27209 = ~We encountered the Luremaster in the dungeons beneath the keep. This time, his challenge was fairly straightforward: Find a way out of the dungeon, or give up and die. Perhaps his third riddle contains some clue that will help us discover a means of escape.

Your host was held unjustly while
The lord so full of wrath and guile
Demanded that this bard should style
A tale to make his people smile.
Suffer not your host's cruel doom;
Use your time to flee his room.
Shadowed dogs lurk in the gloom
And weave escape upon their loom.
If we chance to meet once more,
Your host will have a gift in store.
Defeat our shades in righteous war,
And we will trouble you no more.~

@27214 = ~We managed to force a startling confession out of that halfling codger, Hobart. It seems that he's been in league with the Luremaster all along. He claims that he was forced into serving the ghost, and that he must continually bring adventurers to the castle or the riddling spirit will make a ghost out of him.~
@27215 = ~How many others have come through here?~
@27216 = ~Right. May I look at the goods you've collected?~
@27217 = ~Thank you for telling us. Farewell, Hobart.~

@27233 = ~There is nothing else that you can gain from these two poor souls. Whatever tale accompanied their demise in this pit may never be told.~
@27234 = ~My name is not important. As some say, it is the action, not the actor, who is of principle significance. Your actions in this lure will prove if you are actors of sufficient stature for the roles you are required to play.~
@27235 = ~There will be time enough for destruction in the days to come. In the meantime, enter the lure and take up my challenge. It is in your best interest, I assure you.~
@27236 = ~Some might call it such, but doing so would inject no levity into the matters at hand. Your goal is clear. It is up to you to attain it.~

@27244 = ~No. You may not leave until you have learned the story of what happened here.~
@27245 = ~It is important that you learn what happened here. It is important that I know you are capable of understanding the significance of why I am here.~
@27246 = ~I cannot be the narrator of my own tale. I spent my whole life telling other peoples' stories. The spirits that haunt this place are the ledger upon which my transactions were recorded.~

@27333 = ~Yes, yes... they are. I told myself it wasn't for the money. And really, it wasn't. I was greedy for fame, for glory. I wanted to be *spectacular* in my humility. What a fool I was then. Too bad the currency for my payment was minted in my comrades. Like Dabath.~

Drosus fell afoul of an unusually large group of winter wolves on a solo expedition into the Spine of the World mountains having been forced to don a heavier cloak to keep out of the cold... 

At first glance this cloak appears to be blinding white in color. However, it is in fact a composite of thousands of colors, which dance and play in any available light source. This barrage of scintillating colors tends to distract and partially blind anyone staring directly at the wearer.

The bow was then given to an assassin for hire, Teraven Docen, who was quite successful in bringing down many of the ice-maiden's children over a three-year period of bounty hunting. The assassin met his match, however, when attempting to ambush a traveling gnome who carried a wand of fireballs. Only the bow survived the repeated immolations.

@27366 = ~Chautog's Thinker~
@27367 = ~This rare helm owes its creation to an orcish warrior mage. 

Chautog's unusual story began when his village was destroyed in the crossfire from a battle between two rival wizard factions. One of the victors, the enchanter Shandellon, felt a twinge of guilt when he surveyed the collateral damage and as atonement took in the village's only survivor and raised the young orc as his son. 

Under Shandellon's tutelage, Chautog proved adept at magic despite his crude heritage. However, Chautog constantly found himself working harder than Shandellon's human apprentices and producing inferior results. As jealousy overtook him, Chautog locked himself in his room and toiled day and night on an enchanted item that would allow him to compete with his peers.

The fruit of his labor, though fairly unattractive, was an amazing helmet that would dramatically increase the wearer's intelligence. Chautog immediately donned his prize. However, he quickly discovered that ignorance can be a boon to one whose existence is as pathetic as that of a jealous orc. Shandellon found the charred remains of his adopted son, still wearing the now coal-black helmet, next to a note bearing one simple sentence: "Some things are best left undone."

When worn, Chautog's Thinker confers an Armor Class bonus of 1 and raises the wearer's intelligence by 2. However, the helm is unappealing to look at and quite heavy, being of orc design. Thus, charisma is lowered by 2 and a strength of 17 is required to comfortably wear the helm.

All manner of bandits, murderers, rapists, and other worthies were left dangling from its knotty limbs; and all to the delight of the gravedigger Mordigan. For Mordigan, a secret practitioner of the necromantic arts, saw ample opportunity in which to ply his trade. Interring the remains of the evil men within close proximity of the tree, Mordigan called upon the dark powers of the negative material to perform a baleful act upon the black willow. It was given a sort of semi-sentience, and the ability to feed upon the remains of those who had so recently swung from its branches. Black roots descended into rotting flesh; and alarmingly enough, the tortured visages of the slain began to appear in the twisted knots of the black willow's bole before its burning. But, to the surprise of the villagers, the potently ensorcelled staff carved by the hands of the evil Mordigan did indeed prove to be their undoing. And thus did the hanged men of Dead Man's Tree have their revenge.

On the coastline of the Sea of Moving Ice, there dwelled Prashnak, an abjurer—and a stubborn one at that. Apparently Prashnak was having a great deal of difficulty fending off a relentless scourge of trolls, who no doubt were interested in nothing more than his dug out, well stationed bower. Prashnak used storms of acid to keep the trolls at bay. However the young mage was tiring of the constant attacks, and the trolls were becoming bolder.

After several months of studying the various effects of wilting magic, elemental summoning, and magical methods of frosting, Prashnak was finally ready to try his experiment. After summoning a water elemental, Prashnak evaporated choice bodily components and then froze the hapless creature. This lead to the creation of truly horrific sculptures of ice. The trolls, as simple as they are, took extreme offense to these totems and reportedly fled the area. The experiment a gleaming success, the exultant Prashnak continues his woeful studies to this day. What manner of thief took hold of the bracers is unknown, but they have been missing for several years.

@27373 = ~Skullflail, or "The Flail of Teeth" as it is more commonly known, was constructed in 1035 DR for the barbarian warlord Wychgar. During a battle in the northern wastes which became known as Hallowed Pass, Wychgar lost his three brothers to the orc army led by Kraag the Mighty. Wychgar was distraught and during the night he wandered the battlefield looking for their bodies to take away for proper burial. He stumbled across them and was visited by the brothers' spirits who were trapped between the land of the living and the land of the dead. Unable to help them leave he had their souls stored in the flail with the help of a shaman.

The three heads of the flail are his brother's skulls, which are attached to the shaft by silver chains. The three skull-heads grin maniacally at their new life. When the flail is used in combat the three heads bite the target, tearing and rending flesh.

Some time later, the Grand Sultan gave the weapon to Memnon, the efreeti who did battle with the djinni Calim over present-day Calimshan. Memnon used the weapon very little, deigning to give it to a powerful lieutenant. When Memnon and Calim fell to elven high magic, their servants fled or were driven back to their home planes. It is believed that the Wind of Heaven found its way back into the hands of the djinn after the epic war.

What is known is that a small portion of the dead god's essence found its way to the Astral Plane, where it coalesced into one of the smallest islands of slain divinity. This small hunk of rock and odd ore was captured hundreds of years later by an enchanter named Merdros. Merdros's duergar servants created this blade for the wizard's most powerful warrior ally. Owners of the blade claimed that they could feel the dead god's final memories flowing through the weapon when they held it.

...only Watchknight Giles was not 
deterred by Aehirglass's sudden charge. 
Determined to shield Lord Maluradek's flight,
he refused to give ground to the storming
beast. And so it was by keeping his wits 
about him, his keen eye saw another way the
dragon might be undone. 

With the sun high above him and mace
firmly in hand, he let the dragon's talons
rake at his tabard, exposing his shining 
breastplate to the sun. Not a drop of blood
was shed, such was the skill he had timed
the swift dragon's speed.

He turned so that the breast of his 
gleaming armor caught the sun
and sent spears of the sun's rays
into the dragon's eyes. Unprepared 
for the radiance, the lids of the beast
snapped closed, and his charge faltered,
the beast blinded!

And so with his Wits about him, Giles 
brought his great mace down upon
Aehirglass's skull, drawing the first blood of
the day...

...and the third of the four Watchknights fell, 
his spear planted in the ground against
Aehirglass's charge. The dragon's wings 
were as shreds, its wounds were great, 
but the dragon knew the day was his.

It turned upon the last of the warriors, 
Erris, the fourth Watchknight. There were
no other warriors to be seen, for Lord
Maluradek had still not taken the field.
Erris rushed in to strike but was snatched
up in the dragon's grip, and the creature's
head reared back to bite the Watchknight's
head from his body.

Yet Aehirglass had not counted on Erris's
strength. Struggling against the dragon's
grip, the Watchknight cleaved through its 
neck with his mighty axe, the blade diving
into the gap in the scales of the dragon's throat
left by numerous spear and sword wounds. 

With a mighty cry to Helm, he made two blows
of one! He reversed his swing to catch the neck
from the other side as the talons crushed at him, 
and there was a twin cracking like thunder, 
as the knight's body snapped in the dragon's grip... 

... and the dragon's head lolled from the neck 
like a felled tree, then collapsed to the ground, 
raising a cloud of sand across the Storm-Barrows.

A dragon's death matched with the deaths of four
Watchknights. What can be said of such a valiant battle,
only Lord Maluradek knows. He returned many hours
after the field had fallen silent, but not a tear was
shed for his fallen guards—his eyes swam only with
gold and glory.

"The past is dust," was his eulogy to the corpses of
the Watchknights, "the road ahead is a golden one."~

...the battle against Aehirglass grew long, 
and the sky turned bloody in the twilight as 
the Watchknights fought on. Perhaps one 
extra blade would have saved their lives,
but Lord Maluradek was not to be seen. 

Watchknight Zierkki was quick to dash in, 
strike a blow with his spear, then retreat, 
forcing the dragon to turn and attack, 
exposing his flank for the other knights. Even
near exhaustion, Zierkki fought on, fighting
against time itself.

Yet even against such a foe, he persevered.
No strength was wasted, not a drop of blood
shed without purpose, as the knight fought
on, from high sun to lingering twilight,
wearing out the dragon's strength, 
exhausting it while hoarding his own for 
one final strike against the beast...

...and it was then, Aehirglass rose from its desert berth, 
sand cresting around the azure wyrm like a storm, 
its wings beating like the sails of a mighty sea vessel,
scouring the dust bowl with thousands of teeth, 
each a grain of sand, swift and deadly. 

The fear that had gripped Lord Maluradek 
fell upon our hearts as well, with such weight
we wished to turn our horses and flee with our Lord
to the East, to seek safety within the castle walls.

But then came the crashing of the bravest of
the Watchknights, Geddian, his great sword 
ringing against his shield. The sound gave us
pause and drowned out the roaring of the 
dragon and the wind. The clashing of metal
beat a hymn to Helm, and courage filled our hearts.

"To me, my brothers," he cried. "Steel your 
hearts and raise your weapons! This beast 
shall not take us—our lives for our Lord!"

And thus, bolstered by Geddian's sword-drum, 
we held fast as the beast looped into the sky,
circling our band. Fear rained from its body
yet fell harmlessly upon us like drops of water...

Despite the tarnished surface and the drapery of cobwebs covering this manuscript, the writing within appears to have survived time's passage without fading. 

"My audience with Lord Maluradek went poorly. No sooner had I voiced my request than the Lord flew into a rage. He threatened to lock me in the dungeon with the treacherous bard should I broach the subject of unsealing the crypts again. I returned to the chapel shaken, and my eyes fell upon the symbol of Helm upon the tablet. I fear I have failed my god by not protecting the Watchknights' reputations.

"My Lord's anger at my request has no foundation that I can see, and I find I am now suspicious about what transpired in his battle against the blue dragon at the Storm-Barrows. The four Watchknights who died aiding their lord against such a beast should be accorded honors, not secreted away like skeletons of ill-omen. A castle built upon such crumbling foundations cannot hold.

"I must make amends, do honor to the fallen Watchknights, but I fear to do so without angering his lordship. He of the Unsleeping Eye, the Vigilant One, My Lord and God Helm is the champion of all guardians—yet which do I guard: the reputation of those brave Watchknights that gave their spirits in Helm's service, or the interests of my Lord?

"And of the bard in the dungeons; what crime did he commit that angered... nay, terrified... my Lord so? The Lord has gone so far as to issue a decree that the bard's name shall not be spoken or transcribed. Even hinting at the minstrel's presence in the dungeon is now just cause for Maluradek to punish the transgressor, as one of the poor guards learned a fortnight ago. It seems as if the Lord wishes to erase the bard from history itself. What is it he fears so?

"What tales might the Watchknights tell had they lived?"

* * *

"A plan of action has been discussed with the Adepts at the chapel, and our hearts are in agreement; we shall construct a hidden vault to honor the knights. We shall conceal our efforts from Maluradek, and guard the vault with six keys fashioned from our ceremonial breastplates. We melted each piece of armor down to forge the sextet of keys: copper, bronze, electrum, silver, gold, and platinum. With these keys, we shall be able to enter the Watchknights' crypts and pay our respects while obeying Lord Maluradek's order that the crypt itself remained sealed. 

"Yet my heart is not eased by this act; adhering to the word and not the spirit of my Lord only drags my own cowardice into the light. Yet I can find no true path between Maluradek's wishes and defending the reputation of the Watchknights. I feel as if my spirit is splayed upon a forked road, and I fear the branching shall tear me in two."

* * *

"I heard the bard's song again today from the dungeons. He sang, his voice strong and proud, through the hours of the high sun, through the twilight, and deep into the night before the Lord finally gathered his royal guards and unlocked the dungeons. Not long after their descent below the castle, the singing was silenced, and many of the guards looked pale when they emerged from the dungeon. Lord Maluradek held a bloody dagger in his hands, and his countenance was that of one near the brink of madness. 

"I should have taken action when I saw the Lord and his guards make their way into the dungeons. Now another corpse lies with the four Watchknights."

* * *

"A terror haunts the night. Strange sounds, ghostly shapes, and echoes of the bard's song have been heard throughout the castle. Whatever transpired in the dungeon between the bard and Maluradek has damned this castle and all its inhabitants. The Lord has sealed himself within his chambers, and many of his servants and guards have either left the castle or have vanished.

"I have nowhere to go, so I have stayed. A great weight hangs on my heart, for Helm made his displeasure known to me. As I stood before the offering bowl that holds the symbol of Helm and recited the evening prayers, the waters of the bowl turned dark and cloudy. I placed my hand in the waters to retrieve the symbol, but my hands found nothing. The symbol was gone.

"I felt a spear enter my heart at this; the Vigilant One has seen my cowardice. He has judged me. I am condemned, unworthy to serve as High Watcher—unworthy to live.

"I have made sure that the doors to the chapel are unlocked. Whatever darkness now haunts the night, I await its judgment.

@27467 = ~This red-stained journal looks to have once been professionally bound, but the texture of its sodden pages suggest it was recently dropped in wine or blood and has yet to dry. It is repellent to the touch, and the pages peel back from each other only reluctantly to reveal the scrawled words penned within.

We ride on the morrow for the Storm-Barrows—I, the four Watchknights of Helm, and a bard to tell the tale of our journey. A glorious adventure awaits—and my thoughts race at the treasure to be gained! I am told the beast has laired in the Storm-Barrows for many summers. No doubt that it has amassed quite a horde within its sinkhole! It is fitting that the death of the beast shall fill my coffers and elevate me in the eyes of the commonfolk. No more sullen glances, no more questioning the royal decrees, no more complaints of taxes, and policies, and border skirmishes... my deeds in the days ahead shall carve a new image of me in the eyes of my people, and the words of Lord Maluradek, Slayer of the Storm-Barrows Dragon, shall be as gold!

* * *

Word of my return spread quickly, and a hero's welcome awaited me as I rode through the gates of the castle. With the head of the dragon raised high in my hands, the crowd of peasants fell to their knees in awe. Without delay, I demanded a feast prepared to honor my victory—and to the bard, the chronicler of my journey, I gave the task of writing the tale of my victory over the wyrm. I told him to make haste with his words, for I wished the tale to be ready in time for the feast. 

There was some talk among the peasants and the Acolytes of Helm about what had happened to the dead Watchknights (at the bard's urging, we had carried their bodies back with us, though it slowed us for many leagues), and to prevent casting a pall over the coming celebration, I ordered the Watchknights' bodies be sealed within the crypts. I spoke of their bravery against the dragon in touching words, and everyone appeared moved by their courage. 

I fear unless the Watchknights are interred soon, however, the many wounds upon their bodies will raise questions as to how I emerged from the battle unscathed. It is best not to dwell upon it—as I told the bard, the past is dust. The road ahead is a golden one!

* * *

The accursed bard has betrayed me! His words have cut deeper than any blade. How dare he spout such filth... such lies?! His curdled words of the battle in the Storm-Barrows were treasonous, lifting up the efforts of the Watchknights above my own bravery, and cursing me for displaying cowardice in battle. I! His Lord! 

Oh, but his barbs were subtle. Did he think I could not see his contempt? That I could not hear his lies? I ordered the guards to seize him before he could complete the tale, and tore the foul poem from his grasp. I ordered him taken to the dungeon—I shall see him rot in chains before he ever sees the sun's rays again! 

As he was being dragged from the hall, I ordered the guards to take his hands as punishment. A... harsh lesson, yes, but one cannot permit treachery to abide within his castle, or else he puts all his dominion at risk.

It was only when I burned the venomous pages of the poem that night, I found some of the pages were missing! This concerns me deeply— if they were to fall into the hands of another... but, no, I must not think of it. The tale is ended, the matter of the bard's fate closed.

* * *

The High Watcher of Helm came to see me at noonday, and feigning deference, he demanded I unseal the Watchknights' crypt so that "the dead may be honored." I cast him from the hall—since when are the actions of a hero questioned in his own throne room?! What deed has that priestly fool ever done in the name of his unblinking god that merits even a footnote in history? I will see him on the rack if he dares question my decrees again!

Yet... even though he has said he will do as I ask, I do not trust him; the Watchknights were of Helm, and the Watcher's sympathies lie with them, not I. I shall watch him... I MUST watch him closely. Should he move to betray me, I shall see him rotting with the bard below. 

* * *

One of the guards dared to speak the name of the bard today, and it was like a fresh wound upon my spirit. I ordered the slack-tongued fool lashed to the gallows pole, his mouth choked with peppered rags, and forbid anyone from speaking or mentioning the bard from this day forward. I will crush the bard's name to dust, bury the ashes, and see that he and his filthy words are forgotten by all! A worthy fate for a venom-tongued creature such as he! 

I have taken the only key to the dungeons for myself. I shall keep it close to me even as I sleep. None shall see the bard, none shall feed him, and he shall eventually starve and die! Choke on your own words, traitor, and justice shall be served!

* * *

He sings! The damnable bard sings, and his song seeks me out even through the walls of my chambers! I cannot sleep. It is so loud that I fear none in the castle can help but hear it! Torture me no more, villain, or I shall see you hanged!

* * *

I could bear no more of his singing—the bard is dead. I severed his poisoned tongue, and left as the life rushed out of his body. My guards... they... they are silent now, and they are afraid of me. Good! Let them fear! Let them show respect—they know their lord is not of small courage now!

* * *

The bard lives... yet he does not! His ghost comes to my chamber, singing, taunting me with the tale of my cowardice at the Storm-Barrows! He calls me "hero," but the word sinks into my breast like an arrow. My servants, my guards—they are gone... yet this beast remains to torture me! Silence and peace—I long for both—silence, spirit, be silent, be SILENT!

* * *

I fear I can bear no more; I cannot trust my eyes or my ears. Again today, the urge to put an end to my torment threatens to drown me. What am I to do? I have seen the ghostly hangman's noose swinging within the tower, with a silhouette that looks too much like my own. I fear it is my future hanging from the rafters of the tower. Do I embrace it? No, I must not! There must be some other way! Yet there is no escape from the castle—all corridors bend back to the tower. Is there no release from this hell but death?

* * *

The end nears. The bard's spirit comes again tonight, and I cannot bear his voice again. I go to the tower now, and I shall meet my future with eyes open. I shall deny him the pleasure of killing me himself! He shall be left alone with his words in this foul castle for all eternity! We shall see if he can abide the silence of these halls—at least there shall be small comfort in that none shall hear the tale of Maluradek again. 

From obscurity I have come, to obscurity I shall go.

Level: 4
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: 5 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell the wizard must throw several spider eggs (which is the material component) into the air while saying the final command word. The result is that the eggs morph into fully grown spiders that will remain under the wizards telepathic control. The type of spiders that appear depend upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.

– 7 to 8: Giant spider
– 9 to 11: Phase spider
– 12 and up: Sword spider

When the spell is cast there is a 20% chance that two spiders of the proper type will appear instead of just one. These spider(s) will remain under the wizards control until affected by Dispel Magic, slain, or the spell duration expires.~

There are two parts to this spell. When cast the first part is to open up a small portal which will summon 1 or 2 carrion crawlers to point designated by the wizard. The second part of the magic mutates the carrion crawlers into larger more vicious versions of themselves. The result is that the wizard now has control over these creature(s) until they are affected by Dispel Magic, slain, or the spell duration expires at which point if they are still alive, are returned to normal and teleported back to their original location. When the spell is cast there is a 35% chance that two will be summoned instead of just one.~

Seek me out in the hills of Umar, and signal your identity with the purchase of  * BOOK TITLE HERE *. This will identify you, for I do not know your name, and nor should I. The need for security is paramount, so you must also utter my secret name, constructed from the name of your immediate master. There will be no mistake with this method. 

Our names are the same in their scale and their cut. 
The last of his begins in twofold just as the first of mine.
The next of mine is the first of his, though regressed a full four steps.
The last of my first is the last of his first, except the first one of these is the first of my last. 
The first of his last is mine plus one.
The next of my last is the next after last in the first. 
The last of my last are third and second though they come in first.

I am sorry for such games, but it is certain that only you shall know this. I await your arrival.~

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 7.5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 undead creatures rigidly immobile and in place for five or more rounds. The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be held, while an ogre could not.

The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 ft. of the target is also effected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The control undead spell allows the caster to take control of 1d4 undead creatures within the area of effect. This creates a telepathic link between the casters and the undead, allowing complete control. If the undead have 3 or fewer Hit Dice, then there is no Saving Throw allowed; however, if they have 4 or more Hit Dice, a Save vs. Spell is allowed to negate the effect. The undead remain under control of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are affected by Dispel Magic.~

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes all friendly creatures within the area of effect to be affected by the spell Improved Invisibility. This spell is similar to the Invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. However, telltale traces—a shimmering—allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known).

Invisible characters make Saving Throws with a +4 bonus, and attacks against them suffer a -4 penalty to hit.~
@32429 = ~Invisibility, 10' Radius
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes all creatures within 10 ft. of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or <PRO_HISHER> gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus the invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if <PRO_HESHE> attacks, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first.~

'By Lavok, Master of the Obsidian Sphere

'Finally, I have created  a guardian Golem that is specially suited for the challenging task of cleansing my Obsidian Sphere from planar creatures. It is exceeding efficient in combat, having just recently destroyed a score of Dretch and Chasme demons. However the Golem has recently been damaged. These notes will serve as a reminder to me on the proper method of constructing the Golem should it be destroyed.
'Note to self: Avoid engaging other planar creatures. The exercise is quite difficult and better left to the Golem.
'A standard Golem requires two legs, two arms and a head. These are standard pieces required in the construction of any Golem. Furthermore a special brain is needed to make the Golem function properly. Be wary that some denizen of the Sphere does not steal any of my spare Golem pieces. It would be frustrating to have to actually track down the pieces myself.
'The most difficult task comes after the pieces are assembled in the work room. To activate the Golem you must...

@33347 = ~Your history is nearly as unknown as your future, and the things that are certain seem more fancy than fact. As unlikely as it may seem, you have the blood of a deity coursing through your veins. 

You are a product of the Time of Troubles, a cataclysmic period when the gods were made flesh and forced to walk the earth among their followers. One such deity foresaw both the event and his inevitable death because of it, and so took steps to effect his resurrection. This god strode the land before he was made to, and in his wake left a score of mortal progeny driven to conquer and rule. They were not intended to be his successors, but rather the fuel for his rebirth. Heroes would rise to counter these tyrants, and when their evil fell, it would fall to the father. 

The god was Bhaal, Lord of Murder, and you are one of his children.

You were cared for as a child by Gorion, a powerful wizard that may have had even more powerful friends. It was his influence that allowed you to spend your youth in the library fortress of Candlekeep, where the resident monks schooled you in your skills. Children were an oddity at the keep, though you did have a friend in Imoen. She seemed a kindred spirit, though you knew no more of her background than your own. Gorion never explained how you or she came to be there, or why you needed such a secluded home. It was only after his death that you learned the truth about your bloodline, when you were forced into conflict with his killer, another child of Bhaal.

Sarevok was this sibling's name, and he had embraced his foul origins, determined to exploit them and become the next Lord of Murder. He sought to create death on a massive scale, a war of sacrifice that would prove his claim to his father's throne. You unraveled his carefully wrought plans, and ultimately it was you that took his life, sending his taint back to Bhaal. A victory of sorts... 

Now you face an uncertain future. A child of murder, you have a lineage that will tempt the ignorant to fear you and the unscrupulous to use you. And always the essence of Bhaal is within, exerting its dark pull when you are weakest. Which is the greater fear: Losing your life to fuel the fire, or losing your will and becoming it?~

The Temple of Amaunator shines like a beacon of radiance in the hills of Umar. Amaunator wards us from the shadows of evil. Pilgrims come from areas far off to be blessed by the beauty of Amaunator. Amaunator is endless and without equal.
Yet our god serves us well, in that he is constantly on vigil against shadows. The Temple serves a further purpose towards this end. Amuanator keeps the casters of shadows from walking the land. Any and all who dare to taste of shadow magic should know that Amaunator and his most holy servants will seek them out and cast them into chains  with the Temple.
Lightstone, Dawn's Light, and Sun Rays are Holy Symbols, guides in any spiritual journey that a disciple of Amaunator may embark upon.

'Dark creatures roam the forests. Several townspeople have been slain by some unknown predator. Everyone seems to have their own opinion of what is doing the killing. The strangest thing is that the bodies are disappearing in the morning. This leaves me baffled, for most signs point to a pack of wolves that have been in the area for a long time. Wolves don't steal bodies.
[date]
'Or perhaps I should say wolf-like creatures. At night while I've been patrolling I've often caught shadowy glimpses of these 'wolves' running alongside me. I've tried to attract their attention but they ignore me. I find this most strange, as if the pack is being controlled by someone else. Years ago I spoke with the pack leaders and they were cordial. Now they either flee from me, or, and I fear to say this, they stalk me.
[date]
'It is near noon and still the wood outside my cabin seems full of shadows. I've been hard pressed to hear birds and most of the larger animals have long fled. I plan to find the wolf's den [this afternoon]. All signs point to them as being the culprits, but what wolves act like these? They are wolves with the cunning of men.
'And there is something else, a whispering in my mind. It is faint now, in the waking hours, but while I sleep I dream only of this voice and the face behind it. Whether it is connected to the voices, I do not know. I suspect by the time that the sun sets tonight I'll have answers to my questions.~

@34090 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was known throughout the land, not as a brave and noble hero, but as an idiot. Bards first began to sing of Lilarcor when he was still a young boy. The tales tell us that Lilarcor went North from his small town to battle a devious Treant (at the urging of his 'friends'). Lilarcor walked two days in the dead of winter, found the Treant and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps not) for Lilarcor, the Treant was merely a normal tree and his friends had been jesting with him. No one actually expected him to go fight the fictitious tree. He never did realize his mistake, for after uprooting the tree and tearing it to pieces, he marched back home, declared himself a hero and became the laughing stock of the area.

Soon after that encounter, he became known as 'The One Who Shines... Not Too Much'.

As a weapon, Lilarcor is useful, but many a warrior has passed this sword on to another. Lilarcor's constant banter unnerves even the sternest of fighters. Comments such as, "Ouch, that musta hurt," "Oh yeah! Got 'im good!", and "Beware my bite for it might... it might... it might really hurt or something!" fight a relentless war on a warrior's psyche.

It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor, imprisoned by an evil mage, or some odd coincidence of fate. However, the probability that two creatures as stupid as Lilarcor have ever existed in the realms is highly unlikely. If it is Lilarcor, he has never bemoaned his imprisonment. Chances are he might not realize he is no longer a human anymore...

Once the tutorial area has loaded, an NPC (non-player character) will guide you through fighting monsters, casting spells, the use of thieving abilities, and some of the more common interactions you will experience in the game world.

@34603 = ~Monk~
@34604 = ~Barbarian~
@34605 = ~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May not wear any armor.
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
– May not place any slots in any fighting style.
– May cast arcane spells.
– May not scribe spells into their spellbooks as Mages do. Instead, Sorcerers learn a small number of spells at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.
– Hit Die: d4~
@34606 = ~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: they channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May not wear any armor.
– May only use weapons available to the Thief class (except two-handed).
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in Single-Weapon Style and may not put slots into any other style.
– Moves 2 points faster than other characters. Movement rate further improves by 1 every 5 levels.
– May make 1 unarmed attack per round. An additional 1/2 attack per round is gained every 3 levels. Damage dealt by unarmed attacks increases with level as follows:
  Level 1-2: 1d6
  Level 3-5: 1d8
  Level 6-8: 1d10
  Level 9-14: 1d12
  Level 15+: 1d20
– At level 9, unarmed attacks are treated as a +1 magical weapon and gain a +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls. This enchantment improves to +2 at level 12, +3 at level 15, and +4 at level 25. 
– Receives a +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Spell.
– Deflect Missiles: +1 bonus to AC vs. missile attacks every 3 levels.
– Starts with an Armor Class of 9 at 1st level and gains an additional +1 bonus every 2 levels.
– May use Stunning Blow ability once per day every 4 levels. 

STUNNING BLOW: All successful attacks within the next round force the victim to save vs. Spell or be stunned. This special ability automatically modifies normal attacks; no targeting needs to be done.

– 5th level: Becomes immune to all diseases and cannot be slowed or hasted.
– 7th level: May use Lay On Hands ability on <PRO_HIMHER>self to heal 2 Hit Points per level.

– 12th level: Gains another -1 bonus to Speed Factor.
– 13th level: May use the Quivering Palm ability once per day.

QUIVERING PALM: The next successful attack forces the opponent to save vs. Spell or die. This special ability automatically modifies normal attacks; no targeting needs to be done.

– 14th level: Gains 3% Magic Resistance per level (starting with 42% at 14th level).
– 20th level: Becomes immune to non-magical weapons.
– Alignment restricted to lawful.
– Hit Die: d8~
@34607 = ~BARBARIAN: A Barbarian can be an excellent warrior. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a Fighter, the Barbarian can willingly throw <PRO_HIMHER>self into a berserker rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May not wear armor heavier than splint mail.
– May not exceed Specialization (two slots) with any weapon class.
– May achieve Specialization (two slots) in any fighting style and allocate three slots in Two-Weapon Style.
– Moves 2 points faster than other characters.
– Immune to backstab.

@34655 = ~WILD MAGE: Wild magic is a new type of magic that is characterized by powerful and dangerous surges of unpredictable magic. It has recently begun to attract the attention of many a curious or scholarly wizard. 

Wild Mages are wizards who specialize in the study of wild magic. They have access to spells to protect themselves from wild magic and bend it to their wills. Wild magic is extremely unpredictable and should be used with caution.

Every time a Wild Mage casts a spell, there is a 5% chance that the spell explodes in a wild surge. A wild surge produces some entirely random magical effect. A percent chance is rolled to determine the effect; higher rolls are usually better than lower rolls. A Wild Mage's casting level also varies slightly whenever <PRO_HESHE> casts a spell—anywhere between five levels lower and five levels higher than the Wild Mage's true level.

There are also three spells available to the Wild Mage and ONLY the Wild Mage. These spells are Chaos Shield, Nahal's Reckless Dweomer, and Improved Chaos Shield. With the exception of Nahal's Reckless Dweomer, each of these spells is included in the Wild Mage's spellbook for free.~

@34658 = ~Pick Pocket Succeeded—Target Had Nothing to Steal~
@34659 = ~Spell Trigger is much like Spell Sequencer in that it allows the caster to store several spells in a trigger item that can be released upon any target, including the caster. The spells stored in the sequencer are cast as any other spell and can be accessed through the Special Abilities button on the main screen. It is important to note that when you choose the spells to be stored in the trigger, they will disappear from the ones you have memorized. However, the trigger will last until used, so the caster may rest and gain those spells back. The main use for this spell would be to allow the caster to release multiple spells upon a target very quickly in combat without the possibility of being interrupted.~
@34660 = ~Contingency spells allow the caster to store a spell(s) inside <PRO_HISHER> body. The spell in question will then be released upon the caster when the condition specified at casting occurs. For example, a wizard could place Stoneskins in a Contingency, which could then be set to go off when the caster reaches 50% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points. Then when the caster reaches 50% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points, the spell will be released and cast upon the wizard. The uses for this spell are limited only by the imagination of the caster.~

@34719 = ~Welcome to Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, the expansion pack to Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and the completion of the Child of Bhaal storyline.

Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal is split into two sections: 

1) An Add-In Section—a grand new adventure takes place at Watcher's Keep, a new area on your map in BGII. The keep can be played during the course of BGII. It can also be played after BGII in the Add-On section. Play the Add-In Section simply by loading a BGII save and going to Watcher's Keep. 
2) An Add-On Section—This continues the main storyline of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. Play the Add-On Section by finishing Baldur's Gate II:Shadows of Amn or by importing your character or party into Throne of Bhaal (see below). Watcher's Keep can also be accessed from the Add-On Section. Once you have started the Add-On section, you can no longer return to Shadows of Amn or its areas.

Clicking the New Game button will take you to the character creation screen, where you can create a character to begin Throne of Bhaal at its beginning, shortly after the events chronicled in Shadows of Amn. You have the option of creating a brand new character, who will be outfitted with two million experience points and a variety of powerful weapons and items. You also have the option of importing a character from a saved game or from the character folder. These characters will also be given items and set to two million experience points, if they haven't already reached this level of experience.

Clicking the Import Game button will allow you to import your party from a BGII saved game, such as your final save from Shadows of Amn. This is also an option from which you can load your Throne of Bhaal saves once you've started the mission pack and saved a game.

Click Cancel to return to the previous menu.

@34755 = ~While your foster father did his best to guide you toward virtue, you have always been fascinated by the power that can be attained through evil. Uninterested in spellbooks or knowledge of the divine, you would plead with the Watchers to teach you the deadly art of martial combat. Each teacher, increasingly uneasy about your growing darkness, eventually refused to teach you more. But you would simply move on to the next, casually casting your former tutors away. Your lust for power eventually led you to a forbidden tome deep within Candlekeep, a tome that put you into contact with an evil outsider. In exchange for dark power, you agreed for that outsider to become your patron. Now you seek nothing more than an excuse to leave Candlekeep and exercise your new abilities upon an unsuspecting world.~
@34756 = ~Much to the irritation of your loving foster father, you have always been a wild spirit. Books held no interest for you, nor did disciplined combat. The Watchers spent years wondering what to do with you, until the fateful day when an Uthgardt barbarian from Icewind Dale delivered an ancient scroll to Candlekeep. The short time she remained had a deep impact upon you. She taught you the ways of the barbarian, the connection to spirits of nature, and how to unleash wild rages. By the time she left, you knew that you would follow the same path. Her visit was several years ago, and ever since then you have found the walls of Candlekeep to be intolerably stifling. ~
@34757 = ~Your youth was shaped by two major influences: your foster father Gorion and a group of monks in the service of Bahamut who spent several years within Candlekeep. While Gorion worked to grow your intelligence and kindness, these seemingly strange monks fostered your wisdom and discipline. After they left, you adopted their ways as your own and can now rightfully call yourself a monk. While you treasure the years spent in Candlekeep, you now feel the urge to pursue spiritual wisdom.~
@34758 = ~Inspired by your foster father's knowledge of the magical arts, you took steps to duplicate his abilities. Uninterested in a structured study of magic, you chose instead to harness raw magic and use it how you saw fit. Gorion was kind enough to give pointers here and there, but was never entirely comfortable with your reckless approach to magic. After years of practice, you now feel that you are a capable sorcerer, but could be so much more if you were to travel the realms in search of greater knowledge. ~

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around <PRO_HIMHER>, such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest. The caster can, however, cast defensive spells on <PRO_HIMHER>self and fellow party members. And if <PRO_HESHE> attacks, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first.~

Saving Throw: None

(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Dispel Magic removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.~

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

Fireball is one of the reasons that wizards gained acceptance in the field of adventuring. To cast it, the wizard points <PRO_HISHER> finger and speaks the range at which the fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and blossoms into a fireball, delivering fire damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it: 1d6 points of damage for each level of the spellcaster (up to a maximum of 10d6). Those who roll successful a Save vs. Spell manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, taking only half damage.~

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, all creatures affected function at double their normal movement rate, gain a -2 initiative bonus, and receive an extra attack per round. Thus, a creature moving at 6 and attacking once per round would move at 12 and attack twice per round. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all allied creatures in a 30-ft. radius centered on a point selected by the caster (thus, creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not). This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected. Note that this spell negates the effects of a Slow spell.~

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 10-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes all friendly creatures within 10 ft. of the caster to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature(s) are not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature(s) detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature(s) or their gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature(s) become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature(s).

The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the wizard or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The invisible being(s) cannot open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, etc. If they attack, they immediately become visible, although the invisibility enables them to attack first.~

(Alteration, Illusion)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of <PRO_HISHER> gear become insubstantial. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 or better enchantment, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. The wizard also gains 25% resistance to magic damage. While in wraithform, the caster cannot cast either arcane or divine spells.~
@35691 = ~Dire Charm~
@35692 = ~Dire Charm
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 3
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell works in the exact same manner as Charm Person, with one difference: There is no Saving Throw bonus. Dire Charm affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Save vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster can give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed person by some overt action, or if Dispel Magic is cast upon the charmed person, the Dire Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> is charmed.~

The blue fireshield protects the user from cold damage by surrounding the caster with a shield of ice flame. This shield not only grants the user +50% Cold Resistance, it also protects the caster from attacks made within a 5-ft. radius around <PRO_HIMHER>. An opponent that damages the caster within this radius suffers 1d8+2 cold damage.~

This spell is much like the 3rd-level Monster Summoning I spell, except that this spell summons 4-HD monsters.

These monster(s) appear within spell range and attack the caster's opponents until the spell duration expires or until they are slain.~

When this spell is cast, it generates a cone-shaped area of extreme cold originating at the wizard's hand and extending outward in a 17 ft. cone. It drains heat and causes 1d4+1 points of damage per level of the caster. For example, a 10th-level wizard would cast a cone of cold causing 10d4+10 points of damage.~

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality, <PRO_HESHE> has darted aside and can flee, totally invisible (as per the Improved Invisibility spell), for the spell's duration. A True Seeing spell, a gem of seeing, or similar magical means can reveal the wizard.~

(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Polymorph Other spell is a powerful magic that permanently alters the form of the creature affected. Mental attributes are not affected, and the target does not receive the special abilities of the new form. However, all physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. This is a specific version of the spell in that the recipient will be transformed into a squirrel unless a Save vs. Petrification/Polymorph is made successfully. The transformation is instant and permanent until Dispel Magic is cast successfully upon the affected creature. The natural attacks of the new form also become available, and all clothes and equipment that the target was wearing will mold into the new form.~
@35705 = ~Polymorph Self~
@35706 = ~Polymorph Self
(Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn + 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard is able to assume the form of another creature. The caster also gains the physical mode of locomotion and breathing as well. This spell does not give the new form's other abilities, such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wizard changing personality and mentality.

For the duration of the spell, the caster can transform into any of the new forms at any time and as many times as <PRO_HESHE> wishes. The caster gains the natural attacks of the new form in some cases and may use weapons in others. The mental attributes of the wizard remain the same, but all physical attributes are obtained from the new form. Also, any natural protections that the new form offers are conferred to the wizard, such as the resistance to missile and crushing weapons possessed by the slime form.

The possible forms given by Polymorph Self are:
– Flind: wields a magical halberd (+1 fire damage and strikes as a +3 weapon)
– Mustard Jelly: capable of poisoning or slowing opponents (if they fail a Save vs. Death when hit)
– Ogre: Capable of causing massive damage
– Spider: Causes poison damage when it hits an opponent

In addition, the caster may choose the form of brown bear, black bear, wolf, boring beetle, polar bear, or winter wolf.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard creates 1 image of <PRO_HIMHER>self that will travel alongside <PRO_HIMHER>. The image will perform all of the actions that the wizard does so that if any enemies are trying to attack the wizard, they will not know which one is real. There is a 50% chance that the attacker will attack the image and a 50% chance that <PRO_HESHE> will attack the caster. The image will disappear with a successful Dispel Magic, when attacked, or when the spell's duration expires.~

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

Note: Only one party member may have a familiar.

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the caster must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A Mage has 12 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 9 Hit Points, so the caster gets a bonus of 4 Hit Points. The caster now has 16 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the caster loses those 4 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 12), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 9 damage.

(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 2
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When a wizard calls upon a Power Word, Sleep spell, <PRO_HESHE> causes a comatose slumber to come upon 1 creature (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects). The creature targeted must have fewer than 20 Hit Points and gets no Saving Throw. Attacks against magically sleeping opponents never miss—although they will awaken after the first hit. The sleep effect will last for 5 rounds. This spell has no effect on creatures with more than 20 Hit Points.~
@35715 = ~Ray of Enfeeblement~
@35716 = ~Ray of Enfeeblement
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard weakens an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim is reduced to a Strength of 5 for the duration of the spell unless a Save vs. Spell is made. This spell does not affect combat bonuses due to magical items, and those conferring increased Strength function normally. However, the target receives all the penalties for 5 Strength, such as attack and damage penalties as well as lower weight allowance.~
@35717 = ~Minor Spell Deflection~
@35718 = ~Minor Spell Deflection
(Abjuration)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to the 6th-level spell Spell Deflection, which causes the spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This spell affects a total of 4 spell levels, including spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard and area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud.

This spell will only affect up to 7th-level spells, but as long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the spell deflection.

This spell will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but it will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~
@35719 = ~Protection From Fire~
@35720 = ~Protection From Fire

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3

Saving Throw: None

This spell cancels all Illusion/Phantasm spells of 3rd level and lower in the area. The spells affected are Blur, Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, and Non-Detection. The caster can control whom this spell affects; thus, it will affect only creatures that are not in the caster's party. A target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~
@35727 = ~Hold Undead~
@35728 = ~Hold Undead
(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Range: 35 ft.
Duration: 2 rounds/level

Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds 1d4 enemy undead creatures rigidly immobile. Specifically, it affects the targeted enemy and up to 3 hostile creatures within 10 ft. of it. A successful Save vs. Spell negates the effect.

Paralyzed creatures are helpless and cannot dodge or defend themselves from attacks. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds.~
@35729 = ~Enchanted Weapon~
@35730 = ~Enchanted Weapon
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: 0

@35732 = ~Fireshield (Red)

The red fireshield protects the user from fire damage by surrounding the caster with a shield of flame. This shield does not only grant the user +50% Fire Resistance, it also protects <PRO_HIMHER> from attacks made from within a 5-ft. radius around <PRO_HIMHER>. An opponent that damages the caster within this radius suffers 1d8+2 points of fire damage.~

(Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent until activated
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows a wizard to store two spells and activate them both at the same time from <PRO_HISHER> Special Abilities menu. Both spells must be of 2nd level or lower. To create a sequencer, a wizard must memorize not only Minor Sequencer but the spells <PRO_HESHE> intends to store in it (a Sorcerer can store spells of any level for which <PRO_HESHE> still has spell slots). After casting Minor Sequencer, the player will be prompted to choose the sequenced spells from those <PRO_HESHE> has memorized.

A sequencer lasts until activated and, once used, releases its spells immediately (no casting time). The Special Abilities icon also disappears until the next time a sequencer is formed. A wizard can possess only one Minor Sequencer at a time, and it cannot be given to other characters.~
@35737 = ~Teleport Field~

Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

The wizard instigates a teleportation effect that randomly teleports all enemies in this area for the duration of the spell. Teleport Field is best used against multiple enemies, throwing them into disarray and allowing the wizard to concentrate on activating <PRO_HISHER> defenses.~

@35740 = ~Spider Spawn
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 4
Range: 25 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard must throw several spider eggs into the air while saying the final command word. The result is that the eggs morph into a fully grown spider that will remain under the wizard's telepathic control. The type of spider that appears depends upon the level of the wizard casting the spell:

– 7 to 8: Giant spider
– 9 to 11: Phase spider
– 12 and up: Sword spider

When the spell is cast, there is a 20% chance that two spiders of the proper type will appear instead of just one. These spiders will remain under the wizard's control until they are slain or until the spell duration expires.~

Casting this spell grants the wizard protection from one spell school of <PRO_HISHER> choice. After the spell is cast, the wizard must choose the school <PRO_HESHE> wishes to be protected from.

The spells affected are Blur, Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, and Shadow Door.

@35749 = ~Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental~
@35750 = ~Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 5
Range: 45 ft.

Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

A wizard who casts a Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental spell summons a fire elemental to do <PRO_HISHER> bidding. The elemental has 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell's duration expires, or the elemental dies. However, every time this spell is cast, there is a 15% chance that the elemental will escape the instructions of the caster, go berserk, and attack the wizard who dared summoning it. If it can't reach the summoner, it will fight its way towards <PRO_HIMHER>. This berserking elemental will also remain until slain or the spell's duration expires. The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for 3 rounds after being summoned. At the end of this time, if the caster has won, <PRO_HESHE> has control of the elemental; however, if <PRO_HESHE> has lost, the elemental goes berserk and tries to kill <PRO_HIMHER>. This does not prevent the use of other charm-type spells after the contest was lost. If charm spells are used before the contest is over, they will have no effect on the outcome.~

Level: 5

Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, shadow-like, weightless area of magical force extending from the fingers of one of the caster's hands. The silent, blade-shaped construct's cutting edges inflict slashing damage just as those of a real sword do. The caster wields the phantom blade as if proficient with it, at <PRO_HISHER> normal THAC0.

The phantom blade acts as a +3 magical sword in terms of to-hit and damage bonuses as well as the type of creatures it can hit. However, due to its etheric nature, it causes an extra +10 slashing damage against undead creatures. This sword can only be used by the caster and remains in <PRO_HISHER> hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~
@35754 = ~Magic Missile Scroll~

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular 1st-level spells, creates up to five missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. For every 2 extra levels of experience, the wizard gains an additional missile—<PRO_HESHE> has 2 at 3rd level, 3 at 5th level, 4 at 7th level, up to a total of 5 at 9th level.~

At the end of this time, if the caster has won, <PRO_HESHE> has control of the elemental; however, if <PRO_HESHE> has lost, the elemental goes berserk and tries to kill <PRO_HIMHER>. This does not prevent the use of other charm-type spells after the contest was lost. If charm spells are used before the contest is over, they will have no effect on the outcome.~

A wizard who casts a Conjure Lesser Earth Elemental spell summons an earth elemental to do <PRO_HISHER> bidding. The elemental has 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell's duration expires, or the elemental dies. However, every time this spell is cast, there is a 15% chance that the elemental will escape the instructions of the caster, go berserk, and attack the wizard who dared summoning it. If it can't reach the summoner, it will fight its way toward <PRO_HIMHER>. This berserking elemental will also remain until slain or the spell's duration expires. The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for 3 rounds after being summoned. At the end of this time, if the caster has won, <PRO_HESHE> has control of the elemental; however, if <PRO_HESHE> has lost, the elemental goes berserk and tries to kill <PRO_HIMHER>. This does not prevent the use of other charm-type spells after the contest was lost. If charm spells are used before the contest is over, they will have no effect on the outcome.~

This spell is similar to the 7th-level Spell Turning, which causes the spells cast against the wizard to rebound upon the original caster. This affects a total of 4 spell levels—including spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities—but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard and area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud.

This spell will only affect up to 4th-level spells, but as long as there are levels remaining, a spell will be reflected. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be reflected while canceling the Spell Turning.

This spell will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

When this spell is cast, the wizard is affected by an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from <PRO_HISHER> original position. Meanwhile, an exact image of the caster is created where <PRO_HESHE> used to be, with exactly the same Hit Points as the caster. The image cannot perform any actions at all, such as attacking or casting spells. It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible wizard.

The image will remain under control of the caster until reduced to 0 Hit Points or until affected by Dispel Magic or a spell that reveals illusions, such as True Sight.~

When this spell is cast upon a target creature, there will be two major effects: First, the creature's Magic Resistance, if any, will be lowered by 1% per level of the caster and remain lowered for 1 round per level of the caster. Second, one spell protection of 8th level or lower affecting the creature, if any, will be canceled. For example, if this spell were cast by a 15th-level wizard, the target creature would lose 15% of its Magic Resistance from its current total and one 8th or lower level spell protection affecting the creature would be dispelled.

Spells affected by Pierce Magic are Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, and Globe of Invulnerability. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections.~

Instantly and once per round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile Illusion/Phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells affected are Blur, Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The caster can control whom this spell affects; thus, it will affect only creatures that are not in the caster's party. A target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all magical weapons. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is protected from normal weapons or anyone who is protected by Mantle, Improved Mantle, or Absolute Immunity. Due to the short casting time and duration, this spell is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat. This effect lasts for 4 rounds or until dispelled.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The affected creature functions at double its normal movement and attack rates and receives a +2 bonus to its initiative. Thus, a creature moving at 6 and attacking once per round would move at 12 and attack twice per round. Spellcasting and spell effects are not sped up.

There are three major differences between the 3rd-level wizard spell Haste and this spell: First, there is no period of fatigue following the expiration of the spell; second, this spell will only affect one creature; third, this spell actually doubles the number of attacks per round of the hasted creature.

This spell also negates the effects of a Slow spell, but it is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic. Its effects will last for the duration or until dispelled.~

Upon casting this spell, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of <PRO_HISHER> repertoire of known spells. One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowed—up to 6th-level spells at 18th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster can choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.

For example, a 12th-level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being "the wizard reaches 50% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points." Once the wizard is reduced to 50% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points or below, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon <PRO_HIMHER>. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.

A limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster. Therefore, it should not be an offensive spell, nor can it target any other party members.~

This powerful abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 10 spell levels—including spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities—but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard and area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud.

As long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the spell deflection.

This spell will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but it will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

There are two parts to this spell. First, a small portal opens and summons 1d2 carrion crawlers to a point designated by the wizard. Second, the magic mutates the carrion crawlers into larger, more vicious versions of themselves. The wizard now has control over these creature(s) until they are slain or the spell's duration expires. There is a 35% chance that two carrion crawlers will be summoned instead of one.~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By casting Summon Nishruu, a wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power: the nishruu. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination, this boiling, churning gray mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn toward magic like a moth to the flame, the nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature, and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better.

The nishruu has no physical attacks at all, although physical attacks can hurt it. Each time a nishruu touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around <PRO_HIMHER>, two things happen: First, all magical items with charges in the possession of the target will be drained by 1 charge, destroying them if only 1 charge was left; second, the wizard loses 1 random spell of the highest level currently memorized. The nishruu is completely immune to energy damage, and magic will actually heal it. The creature will remain under the wizard's control until slain or until the spell's duration expires.~

As long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be reflected. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be reflected while canceling the Spell Turning.

When this spell is cast, an illusionary copy of the caster steps out of <PRO_HISHER> body. This copy has the same Hit Points and can cast the same spells as the original caster; however, it cannot make any physical attacks. As long as the image is in existence, the original caster is rooted to the ground and only <PRO_HISHER> projected image can move around; if the image is destroyed, the spell ends and the original caster can move again. Also, if during this time the caster takes any damage, the image will disappear and the caster can move around again. Otherwise, the image will remain for the duration of the spell or until affected by Dispel Magic or anything that reveals illusions, such as True Sight.~

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all weapons of +2 or lower enchantment. This spell is incredibly powerful, yet has a very short duration, and this, combined with its very short casting time, makes Mantle useful only in the thick of intense combat.

This spell allows a wizard to store three spells and activate them all at the same time from <PRO_HISHER> Special Abilities menu. All spells must be of 4th level or lower. To create a sequencer, a wizard must memorize not only Spell Sequencer but the spells <PRO_HESHE> intends to store in it (a Sorcerer can store spells of any level for which <PRO_HESHE> still has spell slots). After casting Spell Sequencer, the player will be prompted to choose the sequenced spells from those <PRO_HESHE> has memorized.

A sequencer lasts until activated and, once used, releases its spells immediately (no casting time). The Special Abilities icon also disappears until the next time a sequencer is formed. A wizard can possess only one Spell Sequencer at a time, and it cannot be given to other characters.~

This spell is similar to the 6th-level wizard spell Summon Nishruu. The hakeashar, in fact, is a more powerful version of the nishruu, with more Hit Points, better attacks, and immunity to normal weapons.

By casting the Summon Hakeashar spell, the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power: the hakeashar. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination, this boiling, churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn toward magic like a moth to the flame, the hakeashar feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature, and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better.

The hakeashar has no physical attacks at all, although physical attacks can hurt it. Each time a hakeashar touches a target wizard and wraps its tendrils around <PRO_HIMHER>, two things happen: First, all magical items with charges in the possession of the target will be drained by 1 charge, destroying them if only 1 charge was left; second, it causes the wizard to lose 1 random spell of the highest level currently memorized.

The Control Undead spell allows the caster to take control of undead creatures within the area of effect. This creates a telepathic link between the caster and the undead, allowing complete control. If the undead have 3 or fewer Hit Dice, then there is no Saving Throw allowed; however, if they have 4 or more Hit Dice, a Save vs. Spell is allowed to negate the effect. The undead remain under the control of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are affected by Dispel Magic.~

The spells from which the wizard is protected are Spell Thrust, Secret Word, Breach, Lower Resistance, Pierce Magic, Ruby Ray, Khelben's Warding Whip, Pierce Shield, and Spellstrike. If one of these spells is cast at the wizard, this spell activates and absorbs the attack. However, this only works once and this spell is consumed in the process.

In other words, any physical damage, such as piercing, crushing, or slashing, will get through. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

A duplicate of the caster is created with this spell. The duplicate is almost identical to the caster, making it a very powerful ally.

When this spell is cast, it launches a massive attack on an enemy wizard's spell defenses. First, the target's Magic Resistance will be lowered by 10% + 1% per level of the caster and remain lowered for 1 round per level of the caster. This cannot be dispelled. Second, Pierce Shield will cancel one spell protection of any level. For example, if this spell were cast by a 15th-level wizard, the target creature would lose 25% Magic Resistance and one spell protection if it currently has one.

Spells affected by Pierce Shield include Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Spell Turning, Spell Deflection, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, and Spell Trap. Magic Resistance does not affect this spell, nor do any of the spell protections.~

This item, the trigger, can store three spells to be released simultaneously, all of which must be of 6th level or lower.

Symbol, Fear is a powerful enchantment that allows the wizard to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until an opponent comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all enemies within the area to make a Save vs. Spell at a -4 penalty or be affected by fear for 2 rounds + 1 round for every 3 levels of the caster.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

An extradimensional space is brought into being upon utterance of a Maze spell. The subject vanishes into the shifting labyrinth of force planes for a period of time that is totally dependent upon its Intelligence:

– Less than 3: 2d4 turns
– 3 to 5: 1d4 turns
– 6 to 8: 5d4 rounds
– 9 to 11: 4d4 rounds
– 12 to 14: 3d4 rounds
– 15 to 17: 2d4 rounds
– 18 and up: 1d4 rounds

Note that if the 9th-level spell Freedom is cast in the area where a creature is mazed, it will effectively bring <PRO_HIMHER> back to this plane, ending the spell prematurely. Note that a mazed creature is not freed through Dispel Magic. This spell has no effect on minotaurs.~
@35834 = ~Spell Trap~
@35835 = ~Spell Trap
(Abjuration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap—making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if a wizard shields <PRO_HIMHER>self with Spell Trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd-level spell), <PRO_HESHE> gets three spell levels back—<PRO_HESHE> will regain one spell up to 3rd level in power.

The spell trap provides 30 levels of protection (i.e. ten Flame Arrows or five Fingers of Death). The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine. It does not work against area-effect spells.~

Level: 9
Range: 80 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast at a target creature, it will dispel all of the magical protections that surround that creature. This includes Minor Spell Turning, Minor Globe Of Invulnerability, Spell Immunity, Globe Of Invulnerability, Minor Spell Deflection, Spell Turning, Spell Shield, Spell Deflection, and Spell Trap. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer-planar creature, the pit fiend, to attack <PRO_HISHER> foes—as well as <PRO_HIMHER>self, if <PRO_HESHE>'s not careful. The caster must use a Protection From Evil spell on <PRO_HIMHER>self (and comrades) to keep the devil from noticing <PRO_HIMHER>. If the caster fails to protect <PRO_HIMHER>self in this manner, the pit fiend will tear the caster and <PRO_HISHER> companions apart piece by piece, then feast on the remains.~

(Abjuration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to all weapons except for those of greater than +5 enchantment. This spell is incredibly powerful, hence the short duration. However, the casting time is also very short, making this spell incredibly useful in the thick of combat, where buying a few seconds can mean the difference between life or death. It is important to note that this spell does not work in combination with Protection From Magical Weapons. This spell lasts for the duration or until dispelled.~

(Evocation)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent until triggered
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Chain Contingency channels some of the magical energy of the wizard and releases it only under certain circumstances. The wizard chooses three spells that will be released under certain conditions, such as being hit by an enemy. When this condition occurs, all three spells are cast immediately. Spells of 8th level or lower may be used in the contingency.~
@35844 = ~Time Stop~
@35845 = ~Time Stop
(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a Time Stop spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop briefly in the area of effect. Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for 3 rounds of apparent time while all other creatures are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the clock. The spell's duration is subjective to the caster. Nothing can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also. When the spell's duration ceases, the wizard is again operating in normal time. Note that all spells cast during the Time Stop will take effect immediately after time returns to normal.~
@35846 = ~Imprisonment~
@35847 = ~Imprisonment
(Abjuration)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the Imprisonment spell is cast and the victim is touched, the recipient is entombed in a state of suspended animation in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the earth. The victim remains there unless a reverse of the spell—Freedom—is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain there as long as the earth exists; rather a horrible fate, actually. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned, then <PRO_HESHE> will reappear exactly where <PRO_HESHE> was last standing. Dispel Magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner. There is no Saving Throw.~
@35848 = ~Meteor Swarm~

Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When the caster utters the words to this powerful spell, <PRO_HESHE> calls upon powerful forces indeed. These forces pull down meteors from above, hurling them randomly at anyone in the area of effect. Anyone caught in the destructive path of the meteors—whether friend or foe—will suffer 4d10 points of fire damage per round until the spell's duration runs out. The caster is well advised to be careful in <PRO_HISHER> use of this spell.~

Level: 9

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

At the culmination of this dreadful spell, the wizard screams like a banshee (groaning spirit). Everyone in the area of effect hears the awful cry. Those who fail a Save vs. Death die instantly. The caster and companions are immune to the effects of the wail.~
@35852 = ~Energy Drain~
@35853 = ~Energy Drain
(Necromancy)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Casting this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining <PRO_HIMHER> of 2 levels of experience. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.~
@35854 = ~Black Blade of Disaster
(Evocation)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to create a black, blade-shaped planar rift about three feet long. It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The caster is considered to be proficient to the point of Grand Mastery in this weapon. The sword acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2d12 damage to its victims. Also, every time it hits a target, the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword drains 4 levels from the target and heals the wielder 20 Hit Points.~
@35855 = ~Shapechange~
@35856 = ~Shapechange
(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

For the duration of this spell, the wizard can assume the forms of several powerful creatures: the mind flayer, the iron golem, the giant troll, the greater wolfwere, the fire elemental, the earth elemental, and the water elemental. The spellcaster can switch between <PRO_HISHER> new forms at will. Thus, <PRO_HESHE> can change into a mind flayer to devour the brains of <PRO_HISHER> opponents and then become an earth elemental to crush <PRO_HISHER> foes. These creatures have whatever Hit Points the wizard had at the time of the shapechange.~

This spell cancels the effects of the spell Maze and returns any characters trapped in the labyrinth of planes. Cast this in an area where you know someone is mazed and they will be released.~
@35859 = ~Wizard Eye~
@35860 = ~Wizard Eye
(Divination, Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends <PRO_HIMHER> visual information. The wizard eye can see with normal vision up to standard visual range and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a wizard eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.~
@35861 = ~Deafness~
@35862 = ~Deafness
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Deafness spell causes the recipient to become totally unable to hear any sounds. Deafened creatures are unaffected by spells and abilities that rely on hearing, and deafened spellcasters have a 50% chance to miscast any spells. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Spell to negate the effect. Deafness can be done away with by means of Dispel Magic, Cure Disease, and similar treatments.~
@35863 = ~Glitterdust~

Level: 2
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. All enemies in the area must roll a successful Save vs. Spell or be blinded (-4 penalty to attack rolls and Armor Class) for 4 rounds. In addition, all enemies who fail their Saving Throw are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades, thus revealing invisible creatures. The dust fades in 4 rounds.~
@35865 = ~Limited Wish~
@35866 = ~Limited Wish

Level: 7
Range: 0

Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Limited Wish is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The use of Limited Wish will not substantially change major realities. The spell can, for example, restore some Hit Points lost by the wizard. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher.

The wiser the wizard, the better chance that <PRO_HESHE> will choose the right wording. Wizards with low Wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~
@35867 = ~Melf's Minute Meteors~
@35868 = ~Melf's Minute Meteors
(Evocation, Alteration)

Level: 3
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent until thrown or dispelled
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates small globes of fire, one for each experience level the wizard has attained, which are held in the wizard's hands in place of <PRO_HISHER> usual weapons. The meteors can be hurled at targets up to visual range and are treated as missiles with a +5 bonus to the attack rolls. Each meteor bursts into a fiery sphere upon impact, inflicting 1d4+3 points of piercing damage and 3 points of fire damage to any creature struck. The wizard can hurl up to five missiles per round.~
@35869 = ~Spook~
@35870 = ~Spook
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 1
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the caster as someone or something inimical, which then appears to advance upon it in a threatening manner. If the creature does not make a successful Save vs. Spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible. The creature suffers a Saving Throw penalty of -1 every 2 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead are completely unaffected.~
@35871 = ~Remove Magic~
@35872 = ~Remove Magic

Saving Throw: None

Remove Magic dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Remove Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.~

This spell causes a major disease and weakness in a creature. The afflicted individual is immediately stricken with painful and distracting symptoms: boils, blotches, lesions, seeping abscesses, and so on. Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma scores are reduced by 2. The afflicted character is also slowed. These effects persist until the character receives a Cure Disease spell.~

When Farsight is cast, the caster is able to view an area of an unexplored map. After casting the spell, simply click on a section of the map that you want to view. For the duration of the spell, the caster can spy on that area, noting creatures and fortifications.~

Symbol, Death is a powerful enchantment that allows the wizard to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until an opponent comes too close, at which point it will explode, causing all enemies within the area to make a Save vs. Death or die. Creatures with more than 60 current Hit Points are immune to this effect.~

This spell causes a giant disembodied hand to squeeze and constrict the target once per round for up to 4 rounds. In the first round, it smashes the target for 3d6 crushing damage with no save, and the target is held. In the second round, the target can save vs. Paralysis at -2 to escape. If they fail to save, the hand does 4d6 damage. In the third round, the target can save vs. Paralysis with no penalty. If they make the save, they are free to move; if they fail, the spell does 6d6 damage and holds them for 2 rounds. After the fourth round, the spell is finished. Magic Resistance will stop the spell.~

This spell creates a huge, disembodied fist that crushes the target and attempts to pin <PRO_HIMHER> to the ground. In the first round, the spell does 2d10 crushing damage, and the victim must save vs. Paralysis at -4 to avoid being held. In the second round, the victim must save vs. Paralysis at -2 or suffer 3d10 damage and be held again. In the third and final round, the victim can save vs. Paralysis with no penalty; if <PRO_HESHE> fails, the hand does 4d10 damage and disappears.~

For a gaijin, or foreigner, to own such a blade is a rare occurrence. Either the gaijin is a greatly honored friend of an important minister, or the gaijin has murdered a samurai.

@35925 = ~This weapon was originally owned by a young officer guarding a diplomatic envoy from Kara-Tur. When the envoy's caravan was ambushed by a small band of yuan-ti raiders, most of the guards were quickly dispatched during a surprise attack, save for one wagon and the young woman defending it. In wave after wave, the yuan-ti charged at the officer, and in wave after wave, they were cut down by the speed and fury of her steel. At last the leader of the yuan-ti raiders faced off with the young woman, and although he did finally overpower her, he was astonished by her skill. The katana she carried was recovered and later enchanted by a high priest of Sseth. The once graceful blade was tainted by dark magic and now guides those who wield it to inflict the severest of wounds upon their enemies.

When this spell is cast, the life energy level of the recipient is raised. This reverses any previous life energy level drain of the creature by a force or monster. The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, and <PRO_HESHE> will likely require rest immediately after the casting, as it will cause days' worth of fatigue almost instantaneously. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.~

The Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against <PRO_HISHER> morals. This effect can only be reversed by Dispel Magic. The target is allowed a Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty to negate the effect.~

The very potent Heal spell enables the priest to wipe away disease and injury in the creature who receives the benefits of the spell. It completely cures all disease and blindness in the recipient and heals all points of damage suffered due to wounds or injury. It also dispels a Feeblemind spell and cures those mental disorders caused by spells or injury to the brain. Naturally, the effects can be negated by later wounds, injuries, and diseases.~

Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the priest to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total number of spell levels equal to half the level of the caster. It includes spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the priest and area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud.

As long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the priest, the spell will be absorbed while canceling the shield.

This spell will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but it will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

The caster of Armor of Faith receives significant protection against melee, ranged, and magical attacks. This magical armor is a force of energy that absorbs a portion of the damage intended for the caster. At 1st level, the damage resistance is increased by 5%, and it improves by 5% every 5 levels of the caster: For example, a 20th-level priest would have +25% damage resistance if protected by this spell.~

This is a powerful combat spell that enhances the priest's physical prowess, transforming <PRO_HIMHER> into a juggernaut of destruction. The effect adds 1 temporary Hit Point per level of the caster, adds 1 point of Strength every 3 levels of the caster (to a maximum of 25), and causes every successful hit to inflict maximum damage. The effects last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

By casting this spell and laying <PRO_HISHER> hand upon a creature, the priest causes 8 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body to be healed. This healing cannot affect creatures without corporeal bodies, nor can it cure wounds of creatures not living or of extraplanar origin.

Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal—or can be cured—just as any normal injury.~

When the wizard casts Chain Lightning, arcs of electrical energy burst from <PRO_HISHER> fingertips. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies near the caster, burning them with electrical damage. The lightning causes 1d6 points of damage for every 2 levels of the caster. If the target of the lightning saves vs. Spell, only half damage is inflicted. Thus, a 12th-level wizard will cause 6d6 damage to a victim (3d6 if the victim makes <PRO_HISHER> Save vs. Spell).~

This spell causes a skeleton warrior to rise and serve the caster under any conditions. The type of skeleton warrior that appears depends upon the level of the priest casting the spell.

– 1st to 6th: A 3-HD skeleton warrior wielding a long sword
– 7th to 10th: A 5-HD skeleton warrior wielding a long sword +1
– 11th to 14th: A 7-HD skeleton warrior wielding a bastard sword +1
– 15th and up: A 9-HD skeleton warrior wielding a two-handed sword +1

The skeleton warrior can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature entering the place, etc. It remains animated until it is destroyed in combat, 8 hours pass, or it is turned. This spell cannot be dispelled.~

  8th Level: -1 penalty to target's Saving Throws vs. Spell.
  12th Level: -1 penalty to the target's Strength score.
  16th Level: +2 bonus to damage roll.~

Second, summoned demons cannot target the protected creature.~

Instantly and once per round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile Illusion/Phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells affected are Blur, Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The caster can control whom this spell affects; thus, it will affect only creatures that are not in the caster's party. A target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

When this spell is cast, all creatures within a 15-ft. radius are affected individually by Protection From Evil. It creates a magical barrier around the recipients at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Second, summoned demons cannot target protected creatures.~
@36008 = ~Sun Soulray~
@36009 = ~Sun Soulray

The character projects a blast of light from <PRO_HISHER> open palm, dealing 1d8 fire damage for every 2 caster levels (up to a maximum of 5d8 damage). Undead creatures take an additional 6 points of damage. There is no Saving Throw against this ability.~
@36010 = ~Greater Sun~
@36011 = ~Greater Sun

The character wreathes <PRO_HIMHER>self in flames that act as a Fireshield (Red), granting the character 50% Fire Resistance and protecting <PRO_HIMHER> from attacks made within a 5-ft. radius. An opponent that hits the character with any weapons or spells within this radius suffers 1d8+2 points of fire damage.~
@36012 = ~Flaming Fists~
@36013 = ~Flaming Fists

The character channels <PRO_HISHER> inner light into <PRO_HISHER> unarmed attacks, turning <PRO_HISHER> fists into flaming weapons that deal an additional 2d6 fire damage per hit for the next round. The duration increases to 2 rounds at level 9, 3 rounds at level 12, 4 rounds at level 15, and 5 rounds at level 25. This special ability automatically modifies normal attacks; no weapon-switching needs to be done.~
@36014 = ~Sun Soulbeam~
@36015 = ~Sun Soulbeam

The character emits a dazzling burst of light that strikes at all other creatures within a 15-ft. radius. The Sun Soulbeam does not automatically hit all targets, but makes a melee attack using the character's current THAC0 (+3 to hit vs. undead). Struck creatures suffer 9d6 points of fire damage (9d6+3 if undead), unless they save vs. Spell for half. In addition, all creatures except the character must save vs. Spell or be blinded for 2 hours.~
@36016 = ~Do not let it happen again!~
@36017 = ~Charm Animal~
@36018 = ~Charm Animal

This spell affects any single animal it is cast upon. The animal is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails its Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), it regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give it orders, and the charmed animal will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed animal by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed animal, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject will be hostile when the Charm expires, regardless of its original attitude. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where it is charmed.~
@36019 = ~Enrage~
@36020 = ~Enrage

The character becomes enraged for 1 turn. While enraged, the character gains a bonus of +2 to <PRO_HISHER> attack and damage rolls as well as to <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class, and becomes immune to charm, confusion, fear, feeblemind, hold, imprisonment, level drain, maze, stun, and sleep. The character also gains 15 temporary Hit Points, which are taken away at the end of the berserk spree (possibly knocking the character unconscious).

After the effects end, the character becomes winded, suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls.~
@36021 = ~When the berserk state ends, the character will take 15 damage.~
@36022 = ~You cannot cast this spell until the current casting has run out.~

@36030 = ~Special Snare~
@36031 = ~Poison Weapon~
@36032 = ~Poison Weapon

Each successful hit within the next 5 rounds will inject poison into the target, dealing an extra 2 points of damage per second with no Saving Throw (up to a maximum of 12 points of damage per hit). Moreover, if the target fails a Saving Throw vs. Poison, <PRO_HESHE> will suffer 1 additional point of damage per round for 4 rounds.~
@36033 = ~Offensive Spin~

During the next 4 rounds, the character's movement rate doubles and <PRO_HESHE> gains a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls as well as an extra attack per round. All attacks deal maximum damage for the duration. Offensive Spin may not be used in conjunction with the Haste or Improved Haste spells.~

This ability allows the warrior to temporarily tap a great inner strength and fight off the effects of malevolent magic. For 4 rounds, the warrior's Magic Resistance is set to 50%. This is not cumulative with other forms of Magic Resistance, so if the warrior already has 50% Magic Resistance or greater, the ability is useless.~
@36078 = ~Critical Strike~
@36079 = ~Critical Strike

A high-level warrior's intimate knowledge of vital spots on opponents allows <PRO_HIMHER> to, once per day, concentrate all of the attacks in one round to strike a vital area every time. With this ability, every attack roll made in the next round is a natural 20, a critical hit.

Requires: Power Attack~
@36080 = ~Power Attack~

@36086 = ~Smite~
@36087 = ~Smite

With the Smite ability, the warrior gains the ability to strike a mighty blow, knocking an opponent back for a considerable distance and stunning the opponent for 1 round. All attacks made in the first round are critical hits. The ability lasts for 2 rounds.

Large creatures such as a dragons or giants will not be knocked back or stunned.

Requires: Power Attack, Critical Strike~
@36088 = ~Set Spike Trap~

@36092 = ~Set Time Trap~
@36093 = ~Set Time Trap

This ability allows the rogue to set a magical trap that casts a weaker version of the high-level Time Stop spell. For 10 seconds, the flow of time slows for all but the rogue. Often, a rogue will use this trap to get behind an opponent for a free attack. ~
@36094 = ~Evasion~
@36095 = ~Evasion

A rogue's natural sense of preservation becomes heightened with the use of the Evasion ability. Evasion gives a bonus of 4 to AC and 2 to all Saving Throws. The effect lasts for 3 rounds.~
@36096 = ~Greater Evasion~
@36097 = ~Greater Evasion

A more powerful version of Evasion, this ability improves Armor Class by 6 and Saving Throws by 3.

Greater Evasion lasts for 5 rounds.

Requires: Evasion~
@36098 = ~Use Any Item~
@36099 = ~Use Any Item

Rogues take pride in their ability to adapt and make clever use of whatever is at hand. This ability is an extension of that basic skill. Once learned, the effect is permanent. The ability allows the rogue to use any item, even items that are typically restricted to one class. This allows the rogue to use everything from wands and scrolls to mighty weapons that none but a warrior could otherwise use.~
@36100 = ~Assassination~
@36101 = ~Assassination

Using every clever trick an experienced Thief has learned in countless battles, this ability allows every strike in the next round to act as a backstab, using the Thief's existing backstab modifier to determine damage.~

@36103 = ~Avoid Death

With extraordinary effort, a high-level rogue can avoid almost certain death. The effect lasts for 5 rounds, and during this time, the rogue's Save vs. Death receives a bonus of 5, Hit Points are increased by 20, and the rogue becomes immune to death magic.~
@36104 = ~Alchemy~
@36105 = ~Alchemy

With cleverness innate to the class, an experienced rogue has seen enough potions in his or her adventuring career to simulate the creation of one. With the Alchemy skill, the rogue can create one of eight types of potions once per day. 

The potions a rogue can create are randomly chosen from the following list: 
1) Potion of Master Thievery 
2) Potion of Perception
3) Potion of Extra Healing

Requires: Use Any Item~
@36108 = ~Enhanced Bard Song~
@36109 = ~Enhanced Bard Song

This is a powerful aid to both the Bard and to <PRO_HISHER> allies. The song gives the Bard <PRO_HIMHER>self a 10-point bonus to <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class and a 10% bonus to <PRO_HISHER> Magic Resistance due to the power of the song. The song also gives <PRO_HISHER> allies +4 to hit; +4 to damage; -4 to Armor Class; immunity to fear, stun, and confusion; +5% Magic Resistance; and immunity to normal weapons.

This ability replaces the current Bard Song.~
@36110 = ~Magic Flute~

This ability creates a magic flute made of pure magical energy. When played, the flute can be used to cast the following spells:
Resist Fear (Party) – 1 charge
Globe of Invulnerability – 1 charge
Delayed Blast Fireball – 3 charges

The spell-like abilities on the Flute are used in the same way that a wand's powers are used. The Flute lasts for 1 day.~
@36112 = ~Tracking~
@36113 = ~Tracking
With an intimate knowledge of <PRO_HISHER> surroundings and the creatures that live within them, a ranger can use the Tracking ability to give <PRO_HIMHER>self a general idea of what creatures are in an area and which direction they are. Red arrows at the edge of the screen will point in the general direction of the creatures in the area.~

This ability creates an almost exact duplicate of the Shadowdancer for 2 turns. The duplicate is created at 60% of the level at which the Shadowdancer is currently on.

@36126 = ~Shadow Maze~
@36127 = ~Shadow Maze

This ability opens a temporary gateway to a small pocket within the Plane of Shadow. All enemies within 7 ft. of the Shadowdancer must make a Save vs. Spell at a -4 penalty or become trapped inside a shadowy labyrinth as per the Maze spell.~
@36128 = ~Shadow Form~
@36129 = ~Shadow Form

This ability temporarily transposes some of the user's tissue with shadow-material, making the subject partially incorporeal. For the next 5 rounds, all physical attacks directed against the Shadowdancer only deal 50% of their normal damage. During this time, the Shadowdancer is also under the effects of Improved Invisibility and cannot be directly targeted by spells.~

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 1
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 2 hours
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This 1st-level spell temporarily blinds its target. A Save vs. Spell is allowed and, if successful, there are no harmful effects. If a victim is blinded, <PRO_HESHE> receives a -4 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> attack rolls and Armor Class.~
@36138 = ~Blur~
@36139 = ~Blur
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 4 rounds + 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Blur spell is cast, the wizard causes the outline of <PRO_HISHER> form to become blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion causes all missile and melee attacks against the caster to be made with a -3 penalty. The wizard also gains a +1 bonus to all of <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throws.~
@36140 = ~Blur~
@36141 = ~Ghoul Touch~
@36142 = ~Ghoul Touch
(Necromancy)

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: Neg.

When the caster completes this spell, a red glow encompasses <PRO_HISHER> hand. When the wizard makes a successful melee attack against a creature, that creature is punched for 1d2 fist damage (Strength bonuses apply) and must make a Save vs. Spell or be paralyzed for 5 rounds.~
@36143 = ~Frozen Fist~
@36144 = ~Frozen Fist

(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the caster causes from 2 to 8 exact duplicates of <PRO_HIMHER>self to come into being around <PRO_HIMHER>. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack—magical or otherwise—it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck. However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.~
@36147 = ~Mirror Imaged~
@36148 = ~Vampiric Touch~
@36149 = ~Vampiric Touch
(Necromancy)

These Hit Points are added to the caster's current Hit Points, with any Hit Points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional Hit Points. The temporary Hit Points last for 1 hour.

Note: This spell cannot be cast multiple times to radically increase the caster's Hit Points. The caster must wait for the first Vampiric Touch spell to run its course before casting another.~
@36150 = ~No need for that, sir. We're not here looking for trouble.~
@36151 = ~Chromatic Orb~
@36152 = ~Chromatic Orb
(Evocation)

Level: 1
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell causes a 2-ft. diameter sphere to appear in the caster's hand. When thrown, the sphere heads unerringly to its target. The effect the orb has upon the target varies with the level of the caster. Each orb will do damage to the target against which there is no save and an effect against which the target must save vs. Spell with a +6 bonus:

 1st Level: 1d4 damage and blinds the target for 1 round.
 2nd Level: 1d4 damage and inflicts pain (-1 penalty to Strength, Dexterity, AC, and THAC0) upon the victim.
 3rd Level: 1d6 damage and burns the victim for an additional 1d8 damage.
 4th Level: 1d6 damage and blinds the target for 1 turn.
 5th Level: 1d8 damage and stuns the target for 3 rounds.
 6th Level: 1d8 damage and causes weakness (-4 penalty to THAC0) in the victim.
 7th Level: 1d10 damage and paralyzes the victim for 2 turns.
 10th Level: 1d12 acid damage and turns the victim to stone.
 12th Level: 2d8 acid damage and instantly kills the victim.

(Evocation)

Level: 2
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: 2 turns/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Web spell creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. The Web spell covers a maximum area of about 30 ft. in radius (roughly the same size as a Fireball). Creatures caught within webs, or simply touching them, become stuck among the gluey fibers. Anyone in the area when the spell is cast must roll a Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty. If the Saving Throw is successful, then the creature is free to move out of the area. A failed Saving Throw means the creature is stuck in the webs unable to move. Each round that a creature remains in the web, it must make a Saving Throw or be unable to move.~
@36156 = ~Lightning Bolt
(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3

Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of energy that inflicts 1d6 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster to each creature within its area of effect (maximum damage of 10d6). A successful Save vs. Spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). When the lightning bolt intersects with a wall, it will rebound until it reaches its full length—hitting the same enemy multiple times, or even members of the caster's own party.~
@36157 = ~Improved Invisibility~
@36158 = ~Improved Invisibility
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 4
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is similar to Invisibility, but the recipient is able to attack by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting while remaining unseen. However, telltale traces—a shimmering—allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus.

Note: After making an attack, the wizard is no longer completely invisible. Opponents can target the wizard.~
@36159 = ~Invisible~
@36160 = ~Chaos~

The effects of this spell are identical to the 4th-level spell Confusion in all respects. The victims wander around as if in a daze, sometimes wandering away, sometimes attacking either friend or foe. If the victim is 4th level or lower, <PRO_HESHE> does not receive a Save vs. the effects. However, if the victim is 5th level or higher, <PRO_HESHE> receives a Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty. The spell lasts for the duration or until a successful Dispel Magic is cast.~
@36162 = ~Defensive Stance~
@36163 = ~Defensive Stance

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2


When the priest calls down a Flame Strike spell, a vertical column of fire roars downward in the exact location called for by the caster. The target must roll a Save vs. Spell. Failure means the creature sustains 1d8 points of damage per level of the caster; otherwise, the damage is halved.~

This spell is a more potent version of the Cure Light Wounds spell. The priest lays <PRO_HISHER> hand upon a creature and heals 17 points of wound or other injury damage to the creature's body. This healing cannot affect noncorporeal, nonliving, or extraplanar creatures.~

This spell removes all toxins from the body, both natural and magical in nature. When this spell is cast upon a poisoned individual, it immediately neutralizes any poison and restores 10 lost Hit Points. This spell will also cure any diseases that the target might be suffering from, as well as blindness and deafness.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the reverse of Cure Serious Wounds. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage. On a successful touch from the priest, the spell inflicts 17 points of damage upon the target. The next attack that the priest makes will inflict this effect, however, <PRO_HESHE> only has 2 rounds to make the attack before the spell fizzles. If the priest misses the target creature, the spell is wasted. There is no Saving Throw.~

Cloak of Fear empowers the caster to radiate a personal aura of fear out to a 3-ft. radius. All other characters and creatures within this aura must roll a successful Saving Throws vs. Spell or run away in panic for 4 rounds. Affected individuals may even drop items. Party members are immune to the effects, although the aura of fear may still disturb them.~

Saving Throw: Special

This spell is only available to Harpers. Harper's Call restores a comrade to life to further service the cause of the Harpers. This spell functions similarly to Raise Dead, with the following exceptions: The Harper must transfer a small portion of her life essence (10 Hit Points) to successfully raise the deceased person; the person has but 1 Hit Point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic; and the raised person suffers a -5 penalty to all ability scores except Constitution for one minute, making this spell virtually useless in combat.~

Duration: 3 tremors
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, a local tremor of fairly high strength rips the ground. The shock is over in several rounds. The earthquake affects all creatures in its area of effect. There are 3 tremors that are caused by the earthquake:

– 1st: All creatures affected take 6d6 points of damage and fall to the ground for 4 rounds. A successful Save vs. Spell with a -6 penalty halves the damage and negates the fall.
– 2nd: All creatures affected take 3d6 points of damage. A successful Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty halves the damage.
– 3rd: All creatures affected take 2d6 points of damage. A successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage.

This spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster's, so care must be taken in its use. Finally, earth elementals dislike mere mortals toying with the land and there is a small chance that casting this spell will cause an earth elemental to appear and attack the party.~

Upon uttering the Bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack and damage rolls by +1. The caster determines at what range (up to 40 ft.) the spell will be cast. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 30-ft. radius centered on the point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effects; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).~

This spell enables the priest to command another creature to "die" (sleep) for a single round. At the end of the round, the creature awakens and is unharmed. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to a Save vs. Spell to ignore the command.~

By means of this spell, the caster is able to cause plants in the area of effect to entangle creatures within the area. The grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about the creatures, holding them fast. Once per round, a creature can attempt to save vs. Spell with a +3 bonus to avoid entanglement. An entangled creature can still attack, but receives a -2 penalty to its Armor Class.~

By using this spell, the priest can create a small magical pebble, which then flies out and hits a target opponent. The stone deals 1d4 points of damage to whomever it hits. The stones are considered +1 weapons for determining if a creature can be struck (those struck only by magical weapons, for instance), although they do not have an attack or damage bonus.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When the priest casts a Sanctuary spell, it causes all of <PRO_HISHER> opponents to ignore <PRO_HISHER> existence as if <PRO_HESHE> was invisible. While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but can use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded priest to heal wounds, for example, or to Bless <PRO_HIMHER>self. The priest cannot cast spells on other creatures without ending the spell.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this spell gains the benefits of a Bless spell (+1 to attack rolls and Saving Throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional Hit Points for the duration of the spell. The Aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more Hit Points than <PRO_HISHER> current maximum. The bonus Hit Points are lost first when the recipient takes damage and cannot be regained by curative magic.

Example: A 1st-level Fighter has 8 Hit Points, suffers 2 points of damage (8 - 2 = 6), then receives an Aid spell that grants <PRO_HIMHER> 5 additional Hit Points. The Fighter now has 11 Hit Points, 3 of which are temporary. If <PRO_HESHE> is then hit for 7 points of damage, 4 normal Hit Points and all 3 temporary Hit Points are lost. The Fighter then receives a Cure Light Wounds spell that heals 4 points of damage, restoring <PRO_HIMHER> to <PRO_HISHER> original 8 Hit Points.~

By means of the Chant spell, the priest brings special favor upon <PRO_HIMHER>self and <PRO_HISHER> party and causes harm to <PRO_HISHER> enemies. When the Chant spell is completed, all attack and damage rolls and Saving Throws made by those in the area of effect who are friendly to the priest gain +1 bonuses, while those of the priest's enemies suffer -1 penalties. Multiple Chants are not cumulative.~

Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 person or mammal
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Save vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster can give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed person by some overt action, or if Dispel Magic is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> is charmed.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a priest casts a Find Traps spell, all traps—concealed normally or magically—of magical or mechanical nature become apparent to <PRO_HIMHER>. A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or unexpected result; the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful; and the creator specifically intended the harmful or undesirable result as such. Thus traps include glyphs and similar spells or devices. Due to the nature of the spell, the caster must stop to concentrate 1 per round which will effectively interrupt any action. This however will not affect spellcasting.~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster causes a blazing ray of red-hot fire to spring forth from <PRO_HISHER> hand. This blade-like ray is wielded as if it were a sword that the caster already knows how to use, hence there are no bonuses or penalties. If the caster successfully hits with the flame blade in melee combat, the creature struck suffers 1d4 points of slashing damage, plus an additional 1d2+4 points of fire damage. However, it is not a magical weapon in the normal sense of the term, so creatures struck only by magical weapons are not harmed by it.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature and any enemy within 7.5 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell holds one or more humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. This includes: brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 7.5 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets, and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

A Know Alignment spell enables the priest to exactly read the aura of a creature. If the creature rolls a successful Save vs. Spell, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. When a character is hit by this spell, it will glow red if evil, green if good, and white if neutral. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Alignment spell.~

When this spell is placed upon a creature, the creature's body is toughened to withstand heat and cold. Complete immunity to mild conditions (standing naked in the snow or reaching into an ordinary fire to pluck out a note) is gained. The recipient can somewhat resist intense heat or cold (whether natural or magical in origin), such as red-hot charcoal, a large amount of burning oil, flametongue swords, fire storms, fireballs, meteor swarms, red dragon's breath, frostbrand swords, ice storms, wands of frost, or white dragon's breath. In all of these cases, the temperature affects the creature to some extent. The recipient has all damage sustained by fire or cold reduced by 50%.~

Upon casting this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation is impossible and spells cannot be cast. Each creature in the area must make a Save vs. Spell with a -5 penalty; if the save is failed then they are silenced for the duration of the spell. Note that this spell does not continue to affect the area after being cast; only those in the area at the time of the casting are affected by the silence.~

By calling upon <PRO_HISHER> deity, the caster of a Spiritual Hammer spell brings into existence a magical hammer, which <PRO_HESHE> can use for the duration of the spell. It strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every 6 experience levels (or fraction) of the caster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 vs. opponents of man-size or smaller and 1d4 upon larger opponents, plus the magical bonus).~

The priest calls upon <PRO_HISHER> god to grant <PRO_HIMHER> power for a short period. When <PRO_HESHE> does this, <PRO_HISHER> Strength, Constitution, and Dexterity are all raised by 1 point for every 3 levels of the caster. A 3rd-level caster would have <PRO_HISHER> abilities raised by 1, while a 12th-level caster would have <PRO_HISHER> abilities raised by 4.~

Call Lightning must be cast outside; otherwise, it will not work, and the spell is wasted. The caster is able to call down one bolt of lightning per round. The spell has a duration of 1 round every 4 levels of the caster. Each bolt causes 2d8 points of electrical damage, plus an additional 1d8 points per level of the caster. Thus, an 8th-level caster will call down two bolts, each dealing 10d8 (2d8 + 8d8) points of damage. The bolt of lightning flashes down in a vertical stroke at any of the priest's enemies. The first enemy struck by the lightning will be the enemy targeted. After that, any enemy (but no allies) may be struck by the ensuing lightning storm.~

Saving Throw: None

Dispel Magic removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect.~

Saving Throw: Neg.

A Glyph of Warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box. Any creature violating the warded area is subject to the magic it stores, although a successful Save vs. Spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph. Multiple glyphs cannot be cast on the same area; however, if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be separately warded. When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the warding sigil. When the glyph is activated, it deals 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the caster.~

This spell holds animals rigidly immobile and in place. Only normal- and giant-sized animals are affected by this spell; monsters such as wyverns, ankhegs, and carrion crawlers do not count as animals. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster; every enemy within 7.5 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

The effects of a Protection From Fire spell last no longer than 3 rounds plus 1 round per level of the caster. When the spell is cast, it confers complete invulnerability to normal fires (torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like) and to exposure to magical fires (fiery dragon breath, hell hound or pyrohydra breath, spells such as Burning Hands, Fireball, Fire Seeds, Fire Storm, Flame Strike, Meteor Swarm, and so on), absorbing 80% of all the damage dealt by such magical sources.~

Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an object, a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the Remove Curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses cannot be countered by this spell, or can be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.~

This spell calls upon energy from the Positive Energy Plane in order to open a channel between it and the targets.

By laying <PRO_HISHER> hands upon a sickly person, the caster can cure almost any disease with this spell. The cure is permanent, but does not grant the recipient of the spell immunity from further afflictions. Blindness, deafness, and feeblemind are also cured with this spell. Some magically created diseases cannot be cured by this spell.~

Zone of Sweet Air repels all noxious elements from poisonous vapors, including magically created vapors such as Cloudkill.

Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Summon Insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack one enemy of the caster. This swarm gathers at a point chosen by the caster within the spell's range and attacks any single creature the caster points to. A successful Save vs. Breath Weapon with a -4 penalty negates the effects; otherwise, the victim takes 1 point of damage every 2 seconds for the duration of the spell. Moreover, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> attack roll and a -2 penalty to <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class. The swarm will repeatedly bite the target, making it very difficult to cast spells (50% chance of spell failure).

Undead, constructs, and elementals are unaffected by the swarm.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

When cast upon a subject, the subject must make a Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty in order to avoid the priest entering <PRO_HISHER> mind. The effects of this spell are similar to those of the wizard spell Domination, with a few minor differences. Most notably, this spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. The priest simply is able to command the subject to perform certain tasks or functions during the spell's duration. To control the subject, the priest must be within range and must be able to see the subject. This control will last until dispelled or for the duration of the spell.~

Defensive Harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an enchanted coordination on their attacks and defenses. This allows a group of creatures to act as a single unit for a single battle or encounter. The effect is always centered on the caster, but affects all those within a 30-ft. radius. Those affected can move outside of this area after the spell is cast and still enjoy the benefits of the harmony. While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +2 bonus to <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class. This lasts for 6 rounds or until dispelled.~

Through this spell, the caster can poison victims who fail their Save vs. Poison. The damage inflicted depends on the level of the caster:

– 13 to 14: 4d8 + 4/round

Through this spell, the caster imbues <PRO_HIMHER>self with the strength and skill of a Fighter of the same level. The priest's Strength is set to 18/00—even if it is normally higher—<PRO_HISHER> THAC0 becomes that of a Fighter of the same level, and <PRO_HESHE> gains 1 temporary Hit Point per level. This will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

This spell affords the caster or the touched creature partial protection from undead monsters with Negative Energy Plane connections (such as vampires) and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. Negative Plane Protection opens a channel to the Positive Energy Plane, offsetting the effects of the negative energy attack. A creature under its effects is protected against any form of level draining for the duration of the spell. This spell cannot be cast on the Negative Energy Plane.~

By means of this spell, the caster calls from 1 to 3 animals that have 8 or fewer Hit Dice. The animals summoned aid the caster by whatever means they possess, staying until the spell duration expires. Only normal or giant animals can be summoned; fantastic animals or monsters cannot be summoned by this spell (no chimerae, dragons, gorgons, manticores, etc.).~

The Cure Critical Wounds spell is a very potent version of the Cure Light Wounds spell. The priest lays <PRO_HISHER> hands upon a creature and heals 27 points of damage from wounds or other injuries. The spell does not affect creatures without corporeal bodies, those of extraplanar origin, or those not living.~

When the priest casts a Raise Dead spell, <PRO_HESHE> can restore life to a dwarf, gnome, half-elf, halfling, elf, half-orc, or human.

Note that the body of the person must be whole, otherwise missing parts are still missing when the person is brought back to life. The person has but 1 Hit Point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic.~
@36330 = ~Iron Skins~
@36331 = ~Iron Skins

Level: 5
Sphere: Elemental
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Druid casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of iron will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is, of course, magical and will hinder the Druid in no way. The effect of this is to protect the Druid from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level Druid would receive 5 skins. For each skin the Druid possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level Druid would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER>, but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally.

The skins will remain on the Druid until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell's duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the Druid from any area attacks, such as Fireball.~
@36332 = ~Champion's Strength~
@36333 = ~Champion's Strength
(Alteration)

Level: 5
Sphere: Law
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spells is cast, the priest effectively draws on the strength of <PRO_HISHER> god and lends it to the target creature, in effect creating a champion. The target gains a bonus to <PRO_HISHER> THAC0 at a rate of 1 for every 3 levels of the caster. So a 9th level priest would confer a THAC0 bonus of 3 to the target, and so on. Also the target's Strength is set to 18/00 for the duration of the spell and receives all the bonuses to hit and damage rolls that this Strength confers. Note also that if the target's strength is above 18/00, it will actually be reduced to this value.

The drawback to this is that the priest must concentrate on the connection between the target and <PRO_HISHER> god for the duration of the spell, hence losing the ability to cast any spells during this time. The effect lasts for 3 rounds for every level of the caster or until dispelled.~
@36334 = ~Chaotic Commands~

Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Chaotic Commands renders a creature immune to magical commands. Charm, Domination, Command, Sleep, Maze, Feeblemind, and Confusion are all spells that fit into this category. This spell also protects the target from Psionic Blast. This spell affects only 1 creature and lasts for the duration or until dispelled.~
@36336 = ~Magic Resistance~

Level: 5
Sphere: Protection
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the recipient receives a resistance to all magic. The resistance conferred is 2% per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level. This resistance is set so that if the target already has more Magic Resistance than the priest would confer, it will actually lower it to the set value. This effect will last for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the reverse of Cure Critical Wounds. Instead of healing the creature touched, it causes damage. On a successful touch from the priest, the spell inflicts 27 points of damage upon the target. The next attack that the priest makes will cause this effect; however, <PRO_HESHE> only has 2 rounds to make the attack before the spell fizzles. If the priest misses the target creature, the spell is wasted. There is no Saving Throw.~
@36340 = ~Slay Living~

Level: 5

Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

Upon casting this spell, the priest has to touch an opponent in order to visit the effect upon them. An item is created upon casting. The next attack the priest makes, which must happen in the next 3 rounds, will use this item. If the first attack misses, the item disappears and the spell is wasted; however, if the attack succeeds, the victim automatically takes 2d6+9 damage. Also, <PRO_HESHE> must make a Save vs. Spell or be instantly killed. Slay Living can be dispelled if cast between the casting of this spell and the necessary attack.~

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 20-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

As with the 1st-level spell Command, this spell enables the priest to command other creatures to "die" (sleep), except that the effects of this spell last 1 round per level of the caster. At the end of the round, the creature(s) awaken and are unharmed. The area of effect is similar to that of a Stinking Cloud or a Fireball.~

When casting this spell, the priest must picture the faces of <PRO_HISHER> fellow party members clearly and focus on the unity of the group. Upon completion, all members in the party are healed 1d8 + 1/level Hit Points. Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal—or can be cured—just as any normal injury. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures. It cannot be cast by evil-aligned characters.~
@36346 = ~Repulse Undead~

This powerful spell creates waves of anti-negative energy that sweep outward from the caster. These waves disrupt any undead that attempt to attack the caster, pushing them away from the caster for several seconds. There is one wave per round for the duration of the spell. All undead are affected with no Saving Throw.~

Level: 5
Sphere: Combat
Range: 0
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a small handful of pixie dust that the caster can use to toss into the air. Anyone hit by the dust becomes invisible (the range of the dust is about 15 ft.). Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature.

The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the caster or recipient cancels it, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. Thus, the invisible being can walk around and cast defensive spells; however, if <PRO_HESHE> attacks, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first.~

When this spell is cast by the priest, a horde of creeping, hopping, and flying insects gather and swarm. This swarm will jump first to the target, then to the nearest allies of the target's, until up to 6 creatures have been affected. Spellcasting within the swarm is impossible (100% chance of spell failure). Creatures in the insect plague sustain 1 point of damage every 2 seconds they remain within regardless of their Armor Class, due to the bites and stings of the insects. Invisibility is no protection. Due to the suffocating nature of the writhing insect swarm, each victim must make a Save vs. Breath Weapon or run away in fear for 1 round.~

The priest employs this spell to set up a wall of circling, razor-sharp blades. These whirl and flash around the caster, creating an impenetrable barrier. Any creature attempting to pass through the Blade Barrier suffers 8d8 points of damage. Creatures within the area of the barrier when it is invoked are entitled to a Save vs. Spell to negate the damage. The barrier remains for 1 turn.~

Upon casting a Conjure Fire Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and a fire elemental is summoned in the vicinity of the caster. There is a 60% chance that a 12-Hit-Dice elemental appears; a 35% chance that a 16-Hit-Dice elemental appears; and a 5% chance that a 24-Hit-Dice elemental appears. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out. All the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication and no need to know the language of the summoned creature. Unlike wizards, priests do not have to engage in a battle of the minds to control their elemental.~

Casting the Fire Seed spell creates 4 fire seeds that will appear in the caster's inventory. The seeds will remain in existence for 3 turns after the spell is cast. If they are thrown at an enemy, a fireball will ensue, causing 2d8 points of damage to all within a 7-ft. radius unless they make a Save vs. Spell for half damage.~

This spell causes a localized folding of space. The folded space takes the form of an invisible disk that protects the caster. Any missile weapon that intersects this disk is instantaneously reversed in direction. Melee factors such as speed, range, and damage are unaffected; the direction of the object or force is simply rotated through a 180-deg. arc. The sender of the missile finds <PRO_HIMHER>self the target of <PRO_HISHER> own attack. The caster of the mirror can direct missile attacks normally through the space occupied by the mirror.~

When the spell is completed, it creates a glowing stone. This gem must be immediately thrown at an opponent, for it quickly becomes too hot to hold. It is not possible for the priest to give the stone to another character to throw. The priest must make an attack roll with +3 bonus and no penalty for lack of weapon proficiency. In addition, the glowing gem can be used to strike any creature, even those hit only by magical weapons, although there is no damage bonus.

When it hits, the gem bursts with a brilliant, searing flash that causes 6d6 points of fire damage to the target and blinds <PRO_HIMHER> for 1d6 rounds. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Spell for half damage and to avoid being blinded. Undead creatures suffer 12d6 points of fire damage and are blinded for 12 rounds (if applicable) upon a failed Saving Throw; otherwise, they receive 9d6 points of damage and are blinded for 6 rounds.~

Upon casting a Conjure Earth Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Earth, and an earth elemental is summoned in the vicinity of the caster. There is a 60% chance that a 12-Hit-Dice elemental appears, a 35% chance that a 16-Hit-Dice elemental appears, and a 5% chance that a 24-Hit-Dice elemental appears. All of the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and it is not necessary to know the language of the summoned creature. Unlike wizards, priests do not have to engage in a battle of the minds to control their summoned elemental.~

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer-planar creature, the pit fiend, to attack <PRO_HISHER> foes—as well as <PRO_HIMHER>self if <PRO_HESHE>'s not careful. The caster must use a Protection From Evil spell on <PRO_HIMHER>self (and comrades) to keep the devil from noticing <PRO_HIMHER>. If the caster fails to protect <PRO_HIMHER>self in this manner, the pit fiend will tear the caster and <PRO_HISHER> companions apart piece by piece, then feast on the remains. Gate can only be cast by evil-aligned characters.~

When this spell is cast, the caster appears to undergo a remarkable transformation and becomes the very ideal of beauty: For a male, this is usually a nymph; for a female, it varies.

As with a nymph, any humanoid viewing the disguised caster must make a Save vs. Spell with a +3 bonus or die of longing for the denied illusion. In addition, all hapless viewers of the transformed Druid, humanoid or otherwise, are instantly smitten with permanent blindness (until dispelled) with no save. The transformation is instantaneous but lasts only seconds, affecting foes near the caster.

Blind creatures are unaffected by this spell.~

Creatures within the area of effect receive 2d8 points of damage plus 1 per level of the caster (i.e. 2d8 + 1/level).

Symbol, Fear is a powerful enchantment that allows the priest to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until an opponent comes too close, at which point it will explode causing all enemies within the area to make a Save vs. Spell with a -4 penalty or be affected by fear for 2 rounds + 1 round every 3 levels of the caster.~

This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All creatures within the area of effect are allowed Saving Throws vs. Spell with a -2 penalty. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell. Those who fail their Saving Throws will either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell.

The spell lasts for 1 round for every two levels of the caster. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature.~

This powerful spell enables the priest to imbue one creature with the ability to regenerate. This regeneration will heal any wounds and even regenerate lost limbs. The creature affected will regain 3 Hit Points per second. The effect lasts for 1 round per 2 levels of the caster or until dispelled. For example, a 14th-level priest would regenerate 18 Hit Points per round for 7 rounds. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.

This spell reverses any previous life energy level drain from the creature by a force or monster. It will also restore the Intelligence score of a creature affected by the Feeblemind spell and negate any form of insanity, such as confusion or berserk. It fully heals the target and cures any diseases or poisons. The casting of this spell is very draining on the priest, and <PRO_HESHE> will likely require rest immediately afterward. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures. It cannot be cast by evil-aligned characters.~

Uttering an Unholy Word spell creates magic of tremendous power. The priest acts as a bridge between <PRO_HISHER> god and the Prime Material Plane, causing a small explosion centered on the priest and reaching up to a 30-ft. radius.

When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, <PRO_HESHE> calls forth a mass of venomous, biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpetlike mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all creatures within 30 ft. of the target. Those trapped by the insects suffer 2 points of damage each second and a spell failure rate of 100%. For each round the victim remains inside the cloud, <PRO_HESHE> must make a Save vs. Spell at -2 or run away in fear for one round. The advantage of Creeping Doom over its 5th-level counterpart Insect Plague is that it does twice as much damage in half the amount of time.~

The wizard's hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: <PRO_HISHER> thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of 5 ft. length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 points of damage, +2 points for each level of the caster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. Spell receive half damage.~

Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell affects any single person it is cast upon. The term person includes any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man-size or smaller, such as brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be charmed, but an ogre could not. The person is allowed a Save vs. Spell to negate the effect.

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw (with a +3 modifier), <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster can give <PRO_HIMHER> orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed person by some overt action, or if Dispel Magic is cast upon the charmed person, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while <PRO_HESHE> was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where <PRO_HESHE> is charmed.~

A Friends spell causes the wizard to temporarily gain 6 points of Charisma. Those who view the caster tend to be very impressed with <PRO_HIMHER> and make an effort to be <PRO_HISHER> friends and help <PRO_HIMHER>, as appropriate to the situation. Officious bureaucrats might decide to become helpful; surly gate guards might wax informative; attacking orcs might spare the caster's life, taking <PRO_HIMHER> captive instead.~

When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Second, summoned demons cannot target the protected creature.~

When the wizard touches a creature while this spell is in effect, an electrical charge will deal 1d8 points of damage plus 1 per level of the caster to the creature touched. In addition, the grasp itself does 1d2 fist damage (Strength bonuses apply). The wizard only has one charge, and once an opponent has been touched, the spell's energies have been used. If the wizard misses, the spell is wasted. The wizard has 1 round per level to touch the target creature.~

Sleep causes a comatose slumber to come upon 2d4 Hit Dice of creatures (other than undead and certain other creatures specifically excluded from the spell's effects). Monsters with 5 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. Though it's not the stuff of which legends are made, attacks against magically sleeping opponents never miss—although they will awaken after the first hit.~

When the caster completes this spell, a blue glow encompasses <PRO_HISHER> hand. This energy attacks the life force of any living creature upon which the wizard makes a successful melee attack. (Nonliving creatures such as golems and undead are unaffected by this spell.) The creature is punched for 1d2 fist damage (Strength bonuses apply) and must make a Save vs. Spell or suffer 1d8 points of damage and receive a -2 THAC0 penalty for 5 rounds.~

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to <PRO_HISHER> own. The target creature suffers 1d4 magic damage, while the wizard gains 1d4 Hit Points. If the wizard goes over <PRO_HISHER> maximum Hit Point total with this spell, <PRO_HESHE> loses them after 1 turn. This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is the Wild Mage's ultimate last-resort spell. When cast, the Mage releases a sudden flood of wild magical energy in the hope of seizing and shaping that energy into a desired spell effect. The attempt usually fails, but something almost always occurs in the process.

To use Nahal's Reckless Dweomer, simply cast it and then choose from your list of known spells. A burst of magical energy is released, which the Wild Mage will try to manipulate into the desired form. The actual effect of the spell is determined randomly by a dice roll on the Wild Surge Table (see the manual for more details).

Because the release of energy is planned by the Mage, <PRO_HISHER> level is added to the dice roll. If the result indicates success, the Mage has shaped the magical energy into the desired effect. More often than not, the effect is completely unexpected. The result might be beneficial to the Mage, or it might be completely disastrous: This is the risk the Mage takes in casting Nahal's Reckless Dweomer.~

When the wizard casts a Detect Invisibility spell, <PRO_HESHE> is able to see clearly any objects or beings that are invisible, as well as any that are astral, ethereal, or out of phase. In addition, this spell enables the wizard to detect hidden or concealed creatures (e.g. Thieves hiding in shadows, halflings in underbrush, and so on). It does not reveal the method of concealment or invisibility, except in the case of astral travelers (where the silver cord can be seen). It does not reveal illusions or enable the caster to see through physical objects.

Note: If an invisible creature enters the area of effect after the spell has already been cast, the creature will remain invisible.~

A Know Alignment spell enables the wizard to exactly read the aura of a creature. If the creature rolls a successful Save vs. Spell, the caster learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. When a character is hit by this spell, <PRO_HESHE> will glow red if evil, green if good, and white if neutral. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Alignment spell.~

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical arrow that speeds to its target unerringly. The arrow has no attack or damage bonus, but inflicts 2d4 points of acid damage (there is no splash damage). For every 3 levels of the caster, the acid lasts for another round, unless somehow dispelled, inflicting another 2d4 points of damage each round. So at 3rd-5th level, the acid lasts 2 rounds, at 6th-8th level, the acid lasts for 3 rounds, and so on.~

When casting a Stinking Cloud spell, the wizard creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 90 ft. away from <PRO_HISHER> position. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful Save vs. Poison at +2 or be sent reeling and fall down for 1d2 rounds. Those who make successful Saving Throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. Dispel Magic will remove the nausea on a particular character, but if they remain in the cloud, then they are still subject to its effects.~

Application of this spell sets the Strength of the character to 18 and then adds a +50% bonus on top of this. The character receives any Strength bonuses appropriate. For example, if a character has between 18/50 and 18/00 Strength, then <PRO_HISHER> Strength will just be set to 18/00. If a character has a Strength between 18/01 and 18/50, then <PRO_HISHER> Strength will become 18/50 + original percentage. If <PRO_HISHER> Strength is less than 18, then it will just become 18/50. However, this spell will actually lower a character's Strength if it is already 19 or more.~

Upon casting this spell, a jet of flame appears at the caster's fingertips and bursts out toward one target of the caster's choice. That target will be hit by this flame for 3d6 points of damage. The flame jet strikes a second time halfway through its duration, and the caster can move while the spell is in effect. There is no Saving Throw against this spell, though anti-fire capabilities such as Fire Resistance will apply and may reduce or eliminate the damage.~

The recipient of this spell can cast spells with a verbal component without having to make any noise.

Chaos Shield increases a Wild Mage's chance to gain a favorable result when a wild surge occurs. Every time a roll is made on the Wild Surge chart, an extra 15 is added to the die roll. When Nahal's Reckless Dweomer is cast, the bonus from Chaos Shield stacks with the Wild Mage's level bonus.~

This spell enables the caster to hurl fiery bolts at opponents within range. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. The caster receives one bolt every 5 levels beyond the 5th (2 bolts at 10th level, 3 at 15th level, etc.). All of the bolts will streak toward the target of the spell.~

This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile and in place for five or more rounds. The Hold Person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of mansize or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level Fighter could be held, while an ogre could not. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 7.5 ft. of the target is also affected. Those who save vs. Spell at -1 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

When this spell is cast, a skull is thrown by the caster at the target area. The skull floats in the area until a creature comes within 20 ft. of it. When this happens, the skull is triggered and explodes damaging everyone within a 30-ft. radius. The damage inflicted is equal to 1d6 per level of the caster, or half with a successful Save vs. Spell. When casting this spell, it is wise to set it far away from the party lest they set it off accidentally.~

By means of this spell, the wizard creates a magical field of force that serves as if it were field plate armor (AC 2). It is cumulative with Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class and, in the case of Fighter/Mages, with the shield bonus.

This spell causes confusion in one or more creatures within the area, creating indecision and the inability to take effective action. All creatures within the area of effect are allowed Save vs. Spell with a -2 penalty. Those successfully saving are unaffected by the spell, whereas those who fail their Saving Throws will either go berserk, stand confused, or wander about for the duration of the spell. Wandering creatures move as far from the caster as possible, according to their most typical mode of movement (characters walk, fish swim, bats fly, etc.). Any confused creature that is attacked perceives the attacker as an enemy and acts according to its basic nature. The spell lasts for 5 rounds plus 1 round every 6 levels of the caster.~

This spell creates a faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e. the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the Minor Globe Of Invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Spells of 4th level or higher are not affected by the globe.~

When a wizard casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is of course magical and will hinder the wizard in no way. The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level wizard would receive 10. For each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER>, but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the wizard until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.~

Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an object, a person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the Remove Curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed item to get rid of it. Certain special curses cannot be countered by this spell, or can be countered only by a caster of a certain level or higher.~

When this spell is cast, the wizard can disturb the emotional state of those around <PRO_HIMHER>. The effect of this is to inflict a feeling of hopelessness upon the enemies within the visual range of the caster. Upon a failed Save vs. Spell, the affected creature will lie down where they stand and give over all their will to a higher power. Sometimes they can be heard to exclaim things such as "I lay down and die," or "I'm going home." This will last for the duration of the spell, upon which they will return to normal.

The secondary effect of this spell is to instill upon the caster the feeling of courage. This will remove any effects of panic and restore <PRO_HISHER> morale, as well as prevent the above from creeping forth into <PRO_HISHER> psyche. There is no Save vs. this and it will last for the duration of the spell. It will, however, be affected by Magic Resistance and other such things.~

When this spell is cast, the result is a globe of shimmering force that encloses the subject creature if it fails to Save vs. Spell. The resilient sphere will contain its subject for the duration of the spell. The sphere is completely immune to all damage; in fact, the only method of removing the sphere is a successful Dispel Magic. Hence, the creature caught inside the globe is completely safe from all attacks, but at the same time completely unable to affect the outside world.~

Duration: 2 hours
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

This spell is very similar to the 3rd-level spell Ghost Armor in that it creates an incorporeal barrier around the target's body for the duration of the spell. This spell, however, actually taps in to the target's life force in order to create the barrier. The armor itself is weightless and does not hinder movement or spellcasting at all.

The spirit armor does not work cumulatively with any other armor; however, Dexterity bonuses still apply as well as magic rings and shields. While in effect, the Armor Class of the recipient will be set to 1, as if <PRO_HESHE> were wearing full plate. Also, due to the magical nature of the spell, <PRO_HESHE> will also receive a +3 bonus to Save vs. Spell.

There is a danger, however, as when the spell runs out, the external portion of the spirit is temporarily lost, inflicting 2d4 points of damage upon the target unless the creature makes a Save vs. Spell.~

This spell causes a skeleton warrior to rise and serve the caster under any conditions. The type of skeleton warrior that appears depends upon the level of the wizard casting the spell.

– 1st to 6th: A 3-HD skeleton warrior wielding a long sword
– 7th to 10th: A 5-HD skeleton warrior wielding a long sword +1
– 11th to 14th: A 7-HD skeleton warrior wielding a bastard sword +1
– 15th and up: A 9-HD skeleton warrior wielding a two-handed sword +1

The skeleton warrior can follow the caster, remain in an area and attack any creature entering the place, etc. It remains animated until it is destroyed in combat, 8 hours pass, or it is turned. This spell cannot be dispelled.~

This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly, yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice, and causes creatures with 5 to 6 Hit Dice to roll Saving Throws vs. Poison with a -4 penalty or be slain. Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those above 6th level (or 6 Hit Dice) must leave the cloud immediately or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect.~

This spell holds 1d4 creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place for 9 or more rounds, unless a Save vs. Spell is made with a -2 penalty. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Any enemies within 7.5 ft. of the target are also affected. Those who succeed on their Saving Throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the worsening of the subject's condition due to wounds, diseases, or poison.~

Using this spell, a wizard can attempt to reduce the Magic Resistance of a target creature. There is no Saving Throw, and the target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

A Sunfire is like a Fireball—an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the caster: 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 15d6. The wizard gestures with <PRO_HISHER> hand, and the entire area around <PRO_HIMHER> erupts in flames, striking everyone except the caster <PRO_HIMHER>self. Creatures failing their Saving Throws take full damage from the blast; those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each taking half damage.~

This spell summons an invisible stalker from the Elemental Plane of Air. This 8-Hit-Dice monster obeys and serves the caster in performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death. The creature remains under the caster's control for 9 hours or until it is killed—at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having to serve a mortal.~

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd-, or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e. the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the Globe of Invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. 5th- and higher level spells are not affected by the globe, and magical attacks of 5th level or higher, such as Spellstrike and Pierce Magic, can bring it down.~

Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power, for when the wizard casts the spell, <PRO_HESHE> undergoes a startling transformation. The size and strength of the wizard increase to heroic proportions, and <PRO_HESHE> becomes a formidable fighting machine.

The spell causes the caster to become a berserk Fighter: <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points double, and all damage <PRO_HESHE> sustains is first detracted from this magically gained life; <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class gains a +4 bonus up to a maximum Armor Class of -10; and all <PRO_HISHER> attacks are made as though <PRO_HESHE> were a Fighter of the same level (i.e. the wizard uses the combat values normally reserved to Fighters, although no extra attacks per round are gained). Each attack also receives a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled. ~

In using this spell, the wizard points at an individual and utters the Power Word. For the next 7 rounds, that creature cannot make any sound.

Upon casting a Conjure Fire Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and a fire elemental is summoned in the vicinity of the caster. There is a 60% chance that a 12-Hit-Dice elemental appears, a 35% chance that a 16-Hit-Dice elemental appears, and a 5% chance that a 24-Hit-Dice elemental appears. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out. All of the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication and no need to know the language of the summoned creature. However, every time this spell is cast, there is a 15% chance that the elemental will escape the instructions of the caster, go berserk, and attack the wizard who dared summoning it. If it can't reach the summoner, it will fight its way toward <PRO_HIMHER>. This berserking elemental will also remain until slain or the spell's duration expires. The elemental is locked into a psychic contest with the caster for 3 rounds after being summoned. At the end of this time, if the caster has won, <PRO_HESHE> has control of the elemental; however, if <PRO_HESHE> has lost, the elemental goes berserk and tries to kill <PRO_HIMHER>. This does not prevent the use of other charm-type spells after the contest was lost. If charm spells are used before the contest is over, they will have no effect on the outcome.~

Any creature with fewer than 8 Hit Dice struck by a ray is blinded for 5 rounds, regardless of any other effect. All creatures caught within the area of effect will be touched by 1 or 2 of the rays, each of which has a different power and purpose:

Upon casting this spell, the wizard causes all friendly creatures within the area of effect to be affected by the spell Improved Invisibility. This spell is similar to the Invisibility spell, but the recipient is able to attack, either by missile discharge, melee combat, or spellcasting, and remain unseen. However, telltale traces—a shimmering—allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient. These traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known). Attacks against the invisible character suffer -4 penalties to the attack rolls, and the invisible character's Saving Throws are made with a +4 bonus.~

<DOTS4>

<DOTS5>~
@36801 = ~Long Sword~

<DOTS4>

<DOTS5>~
@36809 = ~Katana~
@36810 = ~KATANA: The katana is the finest example of the swordsmith's craft, and requires great care to use.

These weapons are hard to find outside of Kara-Tur, so care must be taken when considering this proficiency. After all, skill with the katana is only helpful if you can find one.

WARNING: Magical katanas are very rare in Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition!

<DOTS4>

<DOTS5>~
@36815 = ~War Hammer~

@37068 = ~**PLACEHOLDER FOR MOVIE**
Disaster comes on the heels of your victory in Baldur's Gate, and you are captured while resting outside the city. You know nothing of your assailant, save that you were beaten senseless with apparently minimal effort, and now you lie in a strange prison, awaiting your fate. Vague memories of torture and experimentation haunt you, leaving you battered and without hope. You do not know from where, or even if, help will come; the fate of your comrades is as much a mystery as your own current location.~
@37069 = ~It seems there are always more questions than answers. Your captor, Irenicus, met your escape, though he was already in battle, bested, and taken by wizards in cowls of purple before you could do much of anything against him. Worse still, Imoen was also taken, apparently for the "crime" of using dangerous magics. Now you stand in the square of a great city, the bustle of commerce already absorbing the disturbance you witnessed. You will have to determine what happened to both your missing friend and the man that so callously used you. What was this Irenicus that it took so many to subdue him? And what could *you* do if you found him again? The uncertainty of your situation is unnerving. Hopefully, the citizens of this place will prove friendly.~
@37070 = ~Chapter 10:~
@37071 = ~CHAPTER TEN

As you step into the Abyssal plane, the first thing that strikes you is how suddenly alien it feels. A chill wind sweeps across an empty void, screaming in your ears that you are not welcome here. Several strange, towering structures are present, suspended in the void by an unknown power. All your immortal senses tell you, however, that the powerful essence of your dead father is close and that this place is indeed the Throne of Bhaal.~

The deal is made, and you have a goal, albeit a distant one. Your new "friend" has assured you that passage to Imoen can be bought... though you are certain the final tally will include much more than gold. Any help is welcome, however, and while the cost may be steep, your path is clear. Finding Imoen will lead to Irenicus... and to answers long overdue.~

@37082 = ~Chapter 6:~
@37083 = ~CHAPTER SIX

As much as you have traveled, these last few feet to the surface have seemed the longest trek by far. Your relief at seeing the light of the sky is palpable, even though you were not really fleeing the black of the Underdark, rather the constant treachery. Unfortunately, even though the setting has changed, your immediate future still looks to be far from peaceful. This area has been the staging ground for many recent battles, and judging from the faces of the beleaguered elven soldiers that now approach, there may be more to come. ~

Dust blows around you, clearing a moment later to reveal what can only be Amkethran. A village nestled into an outcropping of rock amidst a desert so dry and sparse of life that you wonder how such a place could survive.

Berserkers tend to be barbarian-like in nature, but not always. Sometimes it is a conscious choice that a warrior in training makes. Regardless, opponents on the battlefield will be unsettled when they see the savage and inhuman elements of the Berserker's personality.

The opposite is true of evil Clerics as well, and there are also many variations in between.

They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

Ettercaps stand around six feet tall, even with their stooping gait and hunched shoulders. The creatures have short, spindly legs, long arms that reach nearly to their ankles, and large pot-bellies. The hands of ettercaps have a thumb and three long fingers that end in razor sharp claws. Their bodies are covered by tufts of thick, wiry, black hair, and their skin is dark and thick.

Barely clearing three feet in height, kobolds have scaly hides that range from dark, rusty brown to a rusty black. They smell of damp dogs and stagnant water. Their eyes glow like a pair of bright red sparks, and they have two small horns ranging from tan to white. Because of the kobold fondness for wearing raggedy garb of red and orange, their non-prehensile rat-like tails, and their language (which sounds like small dogs yapping), these fell creatures are often not taken seriously. This is often a fatal mistake, for what they lack in size and strength they make up in ferocity and tenacity.~
@37398 = ~Kuo-toa~
@37399 = ~Kuo-toa
Kuo-toa are an ancient race of fish-men that dwell underground and harbor a deep hatred for surface-dwellers and sunlight. Insanity is common among the species.~
@37400 = ~Lich~
@37401 = ~Lich
The lich is potentially the most powerful form of undead known to exist, and they are difficult, if not impossible, to destroy. Besides having the power of an undead wizard at their command, they store their life force in a secure location separate from their physical form. Destruction of their body is meaningless unless the container is found as well. ~
@37402 = ~Lycanthrope~
@37403 = ~Lycanthrope
The werewolf is the classic lycanthrope, a person that changes into an animal, though the term can also refer to animals that change into people. Lycanthropy can be a curse or an inherited condition.~
@37404 = ~Mephit~
@37405 = ~Mephit
Mephits are nasty little messengers created by powerful lower planes creatures, and are evil and malicious by nature. Six types of mephits are known: fire, ice, lava, mist, smoke, and steam.~
@37406 = ~Mind Flayer~
@37407 = ~Mind Flayer
Also called illithids, the brain-devouring mind flayers are hideously alien creatures of the Underdark. Evil beyond redemption, they will consider you a slave or simply food, if they consider you at all. ~
@37408 = ~Ogre~
@37409 = ~Ogre
Ogres are big, ugly, greedy humanoids that live by ambushes, raids, and theft. Ill-tempered and nasty, these monsters are often found serving as mercenaries in the ranks of orc tribes, evil clerics, or gnolls. They mingle freely with giants and trolls.

Adult ogres stand nine to ten feet tall and weigh 300 to 350 pounds. Their skin colors range from a dead yellow to a dull black-brown, and (rarely) a sickly violet. Their warty bumps are often of a different color—or at least darker than their hides. Their eyes are purple with white pupils. Teeth and talons are orange or black. Ogres have long, greasy hair of blackish blue to dull dark green. Their odor is repellent, reminiscent of curdled milk. Dressing in poorly cured furs and animal hides, they care for their weapons and armor only reasonably well.

It is common for ogres to speak orc, troll, stone giant, and gnoll, as well as their own guttural language. A typical ogre's life span is 90 years.~
@37410 = ~Otyugh~
@37411 = ~Otyugh
Huge disease-ridden creatures, Otyughs feed on the filth and refuse that other dungeon-dwelling beasts shed or cast aside. This can include adventurers if you are not careful.~
@37412 = ~Rakshasa~
@37413 = ~Rakshasa
Rakshasas are a race of malevolent spirits that hunt and torment humanity. They live for battle, and their illusion talents make them deadly.~
@37414 = ~Sahuagin~
@37415 = ~Sahuagin
Sahuagin are a vicious, predatory race of fish-men that live in warm coastal waters. They are highly organized and greatly enjoy raiding shore communities for food and sport.~
@37416 = ~Shadow~
@37417 = ~Shadow
Shadows are malevolent, undead creatures that drain strength from their victims with their chilling touch. Those so afflicted can look forward to becoming a shadow themselves if contact continues. ~
@37418 = ~Slime~
@37419 = ~Slime
A beast with no visible support within its gelatinous body. The acid touch of these creatures can vary from type to type, but all are deadly scavengers. ~
@37420 = ~Spider~
@37421 = ~Giant Spider
Spiders are aggressive predators, dwelling both above and below ground. Most are poisonous and bite prey before devouring them because unconscious victims are easier to carry to a lair.

Spiders have eight legs and eight eyes. They usually fit into two categories: web-spinners, which have bulbous abdomens and thin, sleek legs; and hunting spiders, which have smaller bodies, larger heads and fangs, and hairy bodies and legs.

Most giant spiders are simply much bigger versions of the web-spinning large spiders.~
@37422 = ~Troll~
@37423 = ~Troll
Trolls are horrid carnivores that are most well known for being hard to kill. All trolls regenerate, and most can only be killed through the use of fire.~
@37424 = ~Umber Hulk~
@37425 = ~Umber Hulk
Umber hulks are tremendously strong subterranean creatures that can burrow through solid rock in search of prey. They are physically slow, but can cause confusion in their target with a glance.~
@37426 = ~Vampire~
@37427 = ~Vampire
The vampire is a powerful undead creature, feeding on the living to further its own twisted goals. Vampirism can infect people of many different species, though the effects are often unpredictable.~
@37428 = ~Priest of Tyr~
@37429 = ~PRIEST OF TYR: Tyr is the deity of law and justice and is primarily concerned with the punishment of wrongdoers and the general furthering of law and good in the world. The belief in justice through (benevolent) force, or at least armed vigilance, is the reason for Tyr's existence. Tyr holds great prominence in the pantheon due to his position as leader of the Triad, a trio of lawful good gods that are collectively devoted to the concepts of courage, justice, perseverance, relief of suffering, duty, obedience, honor, and to some extent, righteous martyrdom.

@37430 = ~After leaving <CHARNAME>'s company, Korgan Bloodaxe lived in as bloody a fashion as he could manage. He took control of an entire dwarven clan, killing their leader in secret and guiding their revenge to a target of his choosing. He could have lived in luxury, but his thirst for carnage was immeasurable, and he stunned the realms by pushing deep into the Underdark. The blind fury of the clan took even the dark elves by surprise, but holding territory in the home of the drow is a hopeless proposition. Korgan was last seen burying his axe in the gullet of a high priest of Lolth, laughing as he struck. Dwarven legend immortalized the image, and his bloodlust is now called a crusade. History, it seems, finds more heroes than madmen.~
@37431 = ~Your struggle to find and kill Lord Roenall takes too long, and almost belatedly you realize that your forces about you have become thinner and are falling back despite themselves.

Other portions of Lord Roenall's army have already begun to surmount the walls of the keep, and within moments the sounds of struggle can be heard from within.

Your forces buckle under the strain of the renewed Roenall assault, and finally break. Panic sets in, and even though you valiantly try to issue orders and gather your troops, it is too late to stop a full rout. Within a short time, Lord Roenall himself has surrounded what few people you have left and is rather smug as he takes you captive.
 
You have lost the day.~
@37432 = ~Incensed at your decisions, a crowd of angry peasants has stormed the gates of the keep, let in by mutinous guardsmen who also thought you abused your power as ruler of the land and manor.

As cries of rage traveled the halls, you were forced to reluctantly escape through a side passage... Even with your skills, a crowd of both peasants and guardsmen could not have been held off for long.

By the time you left the keep, the gentlefolk of the land had taken control of the building... likely waiting for knights from the Most Noble Order of the Radiant Heart or even a new lord to come from nearby. Either way, rule of the de'Arnise Keep has been stripped from you... permanently.~
@37433 = ~As word of Lord Roenall's death spreads through the ranks of the opposing army, their morale breaks and groups begin to disperse in panic. Lone groups of holdouts are quickly surrounded by your cheering forces and dealt a quick death, while others flee as they will, dropping their weapons and returning to the Roenall lands as failures.

The walls have held, and through your actions, the forces of the keep have achieved victory. As your men begin to realize this, they raise their voices in exultation, cheering your name loudly and repeatedly. The day has been won, and the Roenall family has been dealt a lesson it will not soon forget.

This land is yours alone to rule now... and from this day forth.~

When she reached the High Forest, she was welcomed back as a hero and personally congratulated by Turlang the treant. Afterwards, Neera returned to Amn to reunite with the surviving wild mages of the Hidden Refuge, thinking she would find happiness in their company. But Neera was now restless and powerful. She soon departed, making her way to the Moonsea. With the help of a wild surge or two, she sank three docked Thayan slaver ships single-handedly, driving the Red Wizards from the city of Melvaunt. This attracted Thay's attention, and Neera found herself hounded once again by Red Wizards. She enjoyed it, for a time, and at one point even found herself in another alliance of convenience with Szass Tam, but eventually she returned to the Sword Coast, where she lived the rest of her days with her friends and her memories.~
@37475 = ~Neera traveled back to the north, stopping at inns and taverns along the way, always listening happily as bards wove tales both true and false of her adventures with <CHARNAME>. When she reached the High Forest, she was welcomed back as a hero and personally congratulated by Turlang the treant. <CHARNAME> soon joined her. Sometimes going their own ways and sometimes reuniting with their old friends and companions, they wandered Faerûn. Though the Order of Eight Staves was no more, Neera and <CHARNAME> often found themselves opposing the machinations of Thay. One of Neera's greatest feats was the sinking of three Thayan slaver ships single-handedly, an act that drove the Red Wizards to flee the city of Melvaunt. One day, <CHARNAME> woke up and found that Neera was gone. She had left no note, given no sign she meant to leave. <CHARNAME> only smiled, for he knew her destination, and in a few weeks' time, he followed her there.~
@37476 = ~With no one to temper his wrath, it was inevitable Dorn would come to a bad end. Though he escaped the wrath of the gods, there were others whose retribution could not be avoided. Hunted down and captured by a "Freelance Jurist," Mercy Whitedove, he was taken back to Luskan to stand trial. He was found guilty of the mass slaughter of every man, woman, and child in a village called Barrow, where his dark path began. Sentenced to death, Dorn broke free of the prison on three occasions before the sentence could be carried out. Twice, he was tracked down by Whitedove and returned. For their final meeting, Dorn was determined not to be taken alive, and in this respect he was successful. To save her own life, Whitedove was forced to slay the so-called "Butcher of Barrow." Tales of Dorn Il-Khan were told for decades after, both by parents with unruly children in need of discipline and by those vile men and women who admired the half-orc's deeds.~
@37477 = ~To this day, tales of Dorn Il-Khan and <CHARNAME> are told, both by parents whose unruly children need some discipline and those vile men and women who admired the malevolent pair's deeds. Their relationship was a tempestuous one, with each vying to control the other at every turn. Though they successfully evaded the wrath of the gods, Dorn and <CHARNAME> would find it more difficult to escape mortal justice. Dorn was captured by a woman named Mercy Whitedove and taken to Luskan, where he was tried for the mass slaughter of the village of Barrow. <CHARNAME> executed Dorn's daring and bloody escape, after which they spent several years avoiding Whitedove and other bounty hunters. Given their temperaments, the end of Dorn and <CHARNAME>'s relationship was perhaps inevitable. After their umpteenth escape from the implacable Whitedove, the tension between them exploded into violence. Left with little choice, <CHARNAME> slew Dorn and disappeared into the shadows of history.~
@37478 = ~Beyond her acquaintance with the Bhaalspawn <CHARNAME>, little is known of Hexxat, which is doubtless how she preferred it. Cabrina continued to tell stories about the vampire to new agents of Larloch—but replaced the cautionary tale of her loss in Dragomir's Tomb with the inspirational one of her return seemingly from death to complete the mission she was assigned. Decades later, tales would spread throughout Chult of the Faded Woman, a vengeful, demonic entity who targeted clerics of Ubtao and drained their bodies of blood. Whether there's any truth to the stories or not, Ubtao worship declined drastically on the Chultan continent, ultimately continuing only in small pockets of immigrant communities in cities such as Waterdeep.~
@37479 = ~Though it's likely Hexxat and <CHARNAME> had many adventures after the incidents of the Bhaalspawn saga, tales of those adventures are hard to come by, and reliable ones harder still. This is doubtless how Hexxat preferred it. Cabrina continued to tell Hexxat's story to prospective agents of Larloch, replacing her two-hundred-year-old cautionary tale with the inspirational one of her return seemingly from death to complete the mission she was assigned. In less guarded moments, Cabrina could be heard to lament losing Hexxat to "that awful Bhaalspawn." When pressed, she would claim Hexxat and <CHARNAME> spent some years traveling together before settling in Waterdeep, where they were key players behind the scenes in that city's noble and criminal fraternities.~
@37480 = ~human~
@37481 = ~HUMANS: Humans are the predominant race in Faerûn. Humans rule most of the significant empires and kingdoms in the realms. They are the most social and tolerant of races, excepting perhaps the halflings. Humans may advance as any class and are also the only race that can dual-class. Humans may not multi-class.~

@37484 = ~elf~
@37485 = ~ELVES: Elves tend to be shorter and slimmer than humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof. They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing, frolicking, and other similar pursuits. Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry. There are six racial divisions of elves within the realms: gold elves, moon elves, wild elves, sea elves, dark elves (drow), and winged elves (avariel).

Elves have the following traits:
– 90% resistance against charm and sleep magics.

They are given to hard work, and care little for most humor. They enjoy beer, ale, mead, but most of all, they love gold. There are four racial divisions of dwarves within the realms: shield dwarves, gold dwarves, wild dwarves, and duergar.

Dwarves have the following traits:
– +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Paralysis/Poison/Death, vs. Rod/Staff/Wand, and vs. Spell, with additional bonuses based on Constitution.

@37497 = ~HALFLINGS: Halflings are short, generally plump people, very much like small humans. Their faces are round and broad, and often quite florid. Their hair is typically curly, and the tops of their feet are covered with coarse hair. Overall they prefer the comforts of home to dangerous adventuring. They enjoy good living, rough humor, and homespun tales. There are three racial divisions of halflings within the realms: the hairfoot, tallfellow, and stout.

Halflings have the following traits:
– +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Paralysis/Poison/Death, vs. Rod/Staff/Wand, and vs. Spell, with additional bonuses based on Constitution.

@37500 = ~gnome~
@37501 = ~GNOMES: Kin to dwarves, gnomes are noticeably smaller than their distant cousins. Gnomes, as they proudly maintain, are also less rotund than dwarves. Most have dark tan or brown skin, white hair, and rather large noses. Gnomes have lively and sly senses of humor, especially for practical jokes. They have a love for nature that is only matched by their love for gems and jewelry. There are two racial divisions of gnomes within the realms: rock gnomes and deep gnomes (svirfneblin).

Gnomes have the following traits:
– +2 bonus to Saving Throws vs. Rod/Staff/Wand and vs. Spell, with additional bonuses based on Constitution.

@37504 = ~half-orc~
@37505 = ~HALF-ORCS: Half-orcs are born from the union of human and orc parents. They are as tall as humans, but a little heavier due to their muscular builds. Their greenish pigmentation, sloping forehead, jutting jaw, prominent teeth, and coarse body hair make their lineage plain for all to see. Half-orcs are known for their great strength.

But by the time Alorgoth resurfaced, Rasaad's interest in avenging his brother had waned. He finally found the peace he sought as a devotee of the Trust. Offering a more tolerant, less dogma-laden path to those worshippers who had grown disenchanted with Shar or Selûne—or at least the clergy that represented them—he ultimately renounced violence. He and his followers retreated to a remote monastery in the Cloud Peak mountains. There, Rasaad lived the rest of his life in quiet contemplation.~
@37512 = ~Though Alorgoth was not seen again for many years after the events in the Deepstone mines, the Bringer of Doom was not killed there. By the time Alorgoth resurfaced, Rasaad had already been dead for some time. After the events of the Bhaalspawn saga, Rasaad was no longer satisfied to live as a fugitive. He returned to Calimshan, determined to prove his loyalty to the Sun Soul order. Unable to convince the Sun Soul's hierarchy he had truly not parted with their teachings, he was cast out. Denouncing the judgment, proclaiming his innocence, and refusing to leave, the stories say he fought off more than a hundred Sun Soul monks before succumbing to their superior numbers. Haraan Sixscar herself struck the final blow. In the aftermath of Rasaad's death, those present were shocked to realize that not one of those he fought that day had been killed. Later, the monk Gahan, one of those who decided Rasaad's guilt, was revealed to be an agent of the Dark Moon order.~
@37513 = ~Though Alorgoth was not seen for many years after the events in the Deepstone mines, the Bringer of Doom was not killed there. But by the time Alorgoth resurfaced, Rasaad's focus had moved from avenging his dead family members to caring for his new ones. Unable to convince the Sun Soul order of his dedication to them, he and <CHARNAME> went and made a home together in the Cloud Peak mountains. Their seven children enjoyed an idyllic childhood, brought up according to the tenets of the Sun Soul philosophy. But the children were of the Bashir bloodline, and it was only a matter of time before the darkness that plagued their father found them as well. One pleasant spring evening, Rasaad and <CHARNAME> were set upon and killed by Sharran assassins. Another victory for Alorgoth, but it was one that cost the Dark Moon dearly.

The screams of the innocent attempting to flee can still be heard. Yaga-Shura and his army are nowhere in your immediate sight.~

Bodhi was as good as her word, and you are quickly under sail, the flamboyant Saemon Havarian at the helm. The journey is uneventful, and if there were other ships on the same course, they must have kept a discreet distance. You make good time, and soon there is a sizable island on the horizon. It might have been considered a pleasant place, but a grim shadow extends the length of it. The asylum, Spellhold, looms from a cliffside.~

Aran Linvail has proven trustworthy. You are soon under sail with the flamboyant Saemon Havarian at the helm. The journey is uneventful, and if there were other ships on the same course, they must have kept a discreet distance. You make good time, and soon there is a sizable island on the horizon. It might have been considered a pleasant place, but a grim shadow extends the length of it. The asylum, Spellhold, looms from a cliffside.~
@37590 = ~The ship lurches, and the ongoing battle is soon the least of your worries. The entire vessel quickly lists to one side as the cargo below decks violently shifts. There is no chance to make for a lifeboat, and you are thrown overboard, left gasping for air in an undertow you cannot escape. Pressure builds, and you are pulled deep, and you wonder if your last sight will be the disappearing Saemon Havarian, fleeing through some magical means, saving his own skin as always.~
@37591 = ~For better or worse, the Pirate Lord has declared you worthy of confinement in Spellhold. The fact that you requested to go probably played a factor in his decision, and as you near the institution in shackles, you understand why. The cliff-bound complex appears deathly cold, not at all like a place of healing. The cells within prove no less desolate; what else but madness would bring you here?~
@37592 = ~The seas are calm, but the voyage is tense, and Saemon spends much of his time below decks. He acts as though he expects some great tragedy and that by avoiding you, he can escape its influence. The course he has set is true though, and you think you will make the mainland in a few days. On the fourth morn, a ship is spotted to the east, and a visibly shaken Saemon orders a change of course. The winds are against him, however, and the other vessel makes steady and remarkable progress towards you. Saemon grows increasingly nervous, and rightfully so: The ship looks odd, and you swear it may not even be resting upon the water. Inevitably, it pulls alongside and reveals a crew like no other. Saemon orders everyone to have weapons at the ready...~
@37593 = ~CHAPTER FIVE

The great depths of the Underdark stretch before you, and as you adjust to the dim light, the reality of where you are begins to sink in. It is a realm of countless legends, where evil lurks behind each shadow, and though you have traveled far in pursuit of Irenicus, never have you felt so isolated. As black as your situation may have seemed, it somehow grows darker still. ~
@37594 = ~CHAPTER SEVEN

Guided by the light of the Rhynn Lanthorn, you pass effortlessly through what had seemed an impenetrable wall of trees. The city that greets you as you emerge is at once inspiring, but also profoundly troubling, for amidst the majestic architecture are dozens of bodies, elves that have fallen while defending their home. Suldanessellar is in the grip of Irenicus and his minions, and it will not be relinquished without a fight. ~

@37727 = ~Two-Handed Weapon Style~
@37728 = ~TWO-HANDED: This fighting style allows the character to use a two-handed melee weapon and receive special bonuses.

Proficient (1 slot): The wielder gets a +1 bonus to damage rolls, a -2 bonus to Speed Factor, and the ability to score critical hits on a roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) when using a two-handed weapon.

Specialized (2 slots): The wielder gets a further -2 bonus to Speed Factor.

NOTE: Magical two-handed weapons are more powerful than their single-handed counterparts. This counterbalances the fact that you can't use a second weapon or shield when using a two-handed weapon.~
@37729 = ~Sword and Shield Style~
@37730 = ~SWORD AND SHIELD: Anyone can pick up a shield and get its basic protection bonuses, but by spending slots on this fighting style, an adventurer can maximize the benefits received.

Specialized (2 slots): The wielder gets a -4 bonus to AC against missile weapons.

NOTE: Despite the name of this style, any one-handed melee weapon in combination with a shield will receive the aforementioned bonuses.~
@37731 = ~Single Weapon Style~
@37732 = ~SINGLE-WEAPON: This fighting style is for characters who do not wish to use a shield but want some bonus when using a one-handed melee weapon.

Proficient (1 slot): The wielder gets a -1 bonus to AC and inflicts critical damage on an attack roll of 19 or 20.

Specialized (2 slots): The wielder gets a -2 bonus to AC and inflicts critical damage on an attack roll of 19 or 20.~
@37733 = ~Two Weapon Style~
@37734 = ~TWO-WEAPON: This fighting style allows the character to use two melee weapons at the same time with fewer penalties. A character wielding two weapons without a slot in this fighting style would incur a -4 penalty to attack rolls with the main weapon and a -8 penalty with the off-hand weapon. 

Proficient (1 slot): The wielder's penalties are reduced to -2 with the main weapon and -6 with the off-hand weapon.

Specialized (2 slots): The wielder's penalties are reduced to 0 with the main weapon and -4 with the off-hand weapon.

Master (3 slots): The wielder's penalties are reduced to 0 with the main weapon and -2 with the off-hand weapon.~

The legends of Wilson passed down through the generations are countless, but a few stand out. A favorite among the deer and gazelle, and to a lesser extent the hyenas, is the story of how he freed countless species from the tyrannical rule of a corrupt Lion Kingdom. After ending his own kind's murderous rampage against fish, he was the first and only mammal ever to be made a saint to the salmon. But perhaps his greatest triumph came when he forged a lasting peace in the ages-old conflict between cats and dogs. For all these things and more, Wilson is remembered fondly by all good and steadfast members of the wild kingdom.

@37979 = ~My dear <GIRLBOY>, I don't know you from Drizzt. Leave me be.~

@37991 = ~The village has been quiet since the Umar business, I take it?~
@37992 = ~You know quite a bit about the area's history, Nelleck... what can you tell me about it?~
@37993 = ~No, thanks.~
@37994 = ~Not much, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger... that noble came an' didn't even talk to the minister. Just marched on over there with 'is men, easy as ye please.~
@37995 = ~There was lots o' relics and such left from th' days when mithral was mined in th' hills... but most of it's long gone. I don't think he'll find none.~
@37996 = ~ 'At don't mean he won't disturb the forest, or burn it down while he's goin' about 'is business. Tsk... a real shame. Me pa said that area's all holy ground.~
@37997 = ~None. Like I've said before... Madulf an' 'em are pretty quiet an' keep t' themselves, mostly. I don't think they wants any trouble.~
@37998 = ~Better than ye'd think, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Madulf and a couple o' others have been in an' out a few times... buyin' food an' usin' the inn.~
@37999 = ~Folks were scared at first, but they've been real polite. Keepin' a low profile too... as low as 'em big 'uns can get, anyway. The merchants like it, anyhow.~
@38000 = ~Nay. They're long gone... an' good riddance. Got what they came for, didn't they? Heh...~
@38001 = ~Nay... no one's come. Nasty bugger wasn't liked much even by them other nobles, I guess. The sacred ground will stay as it is, more or less undisturbed.~
@38002 = ~Aye. Even Johanna went an' thanked Madulf personally. And now Imnesvale's got defenders like no one else. Who'd 'ave thought, aye, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@38003 = ~Be a dear... ferry my belongings outside. Then you can go back to polishing your helm, or whatever it is you paladins do when you're not saving the helpless girl.~
@38004 = ~Mist Horror~
@38005 = ~Aye. No one expected Madulf and his followers t' actually help anyone. They been by t' trade things an' such... real polite. People are mighty thankful.~
@38006 = ~Nay, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. No sightings. Been a long time since them orcs attacked... an' I think they'll think twice now 'fore they try it again.~
@38007 = ~Get back upstairs, brat! I'll decide when it's safe for you to leave!~
@38008 = ~I would appreciate it if you would go back upstairs. It is for your own safety.~

@38010 = ~Whatever. Got some real control issues to work out, I think. Sound like Mother, you do. I'll probably get more from Hurgis too. Moralizing old coot.~
@38011 = ~Well... the village has been here for centuries, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Even during Umar's rule... although it was a darker place then, an' mostly just farms an' such.~
@38012 = ~There was a rush a few centuries back... found mithral in th' hills. Temples and such were built all o'er the place, then abandoned when the mines ran dry.~
@38013 = ~All the nobles an' priests left, an' everythin' they built has fallen into ruin. Lots o' creatures moved into them dark places... 'at's why we needed a ranger.~
@38014 = ~Whatever. Got some real control issues to work out, I think. Sound like Father, you do. I'll probably get more from Hurgis too. Moralizing old coot.~

@38017 = ~Despite all ye've done fer us, ye're no longer welcome here, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Yer type... well, maybe ye'd better just be on yer way.~
@38018 = ~There's ogrons come from the hills, my <LADYLORD>... orcs with ogre blood in 'em. They're gathered near the cave north o' the river, plannin' to attack the village.~

@38023 = ~There's ogrons come from th' hills, my <LADYLORD>... orcs mixed with ogre blood. That ogre, Madulf, an' his followers... they've been fightin' them for the village.~

@38069 = ~I doubt she will, though I attended her birth. No, you have only my word and the word of your superiors. That should suffice for a creature of duty such as you.~
@38070 = ~I doubt she will, though I attended her birth. No, you have only my word and the word of your superiors. That should suffice for a creature of duty such as you.~
@38071 = ~You have my word and the instruction of your Order. That should be enough. You value your service to the Order, do you not? Of course you do.~
@38072 = ~You have my word and the instruction of your Order. That should be enough. You value your service to the Order, do you not? Of course you do.~
@38073 = ~Greetings, <GABBER>. We have not forgotten what you or our ranger have done for us, certainly... you are welcome to stay in our village as long as you like.~
@38074 = ~Now inform the child that I am here for her. I do not wish to tarry in this place, for it is known to her enemies. Be quick now.~
@38075 = ~Now inform the child that I am here for her. I do not wish to tarry in this place, for it is known to her enemies. Be quick now.~
@38076 = ~I cannot wait long; assassins will be rallying. True safety will only come back at my estate in Baldur's Gate. Deliver my goddaughter as ordered.~
@38077 = ~I cannot wait long; assassins will be rallying. True safety will only come back at my estate in Baldur's Gate. Deliver my goddaughter as ordered.~
@38078 = ~Actually... this is a matter I really must talk to our <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger about, my <LADYLORD>. No offense...~
@38079 = ~Actually... the matter of the ogrons is something I really must talk to our <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger about, my <LADYLORD>. No offense...~
@38080 = ~Of course, sire. Forgive my cautious nature.~
@38081 = ~I must insist on some verification of your identity. I must be sure.~
@38082 = ~And what if you turn out to be some cutthroat in disguise? Can I trust you?~
@38083 = ~Of course, sire. Forgive my cautious nature.~
@38084 = ~I must insist on some verification of your identity. I must be sure.~
@38085 = ~And what if you turn out to be some cutthroat in disguise? Can I trust you?~
@38086 = ~Despite all you and our former ranger have done for us... you are no longer welcome within our village. It... it is a pity. I wish you all well.~
@38087 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger. I trust all goes well in your cabin and your adventures elsewhere? Feel free to come and go as you like, of course.~
@38088 = ~Caution must give way to action eventually, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Worry all you wish, but bring the child now or all is lost.~
@38089 = ~Caution must give way to action eventually, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Worry all you wish, but bring the child now or all is lost.~
@38090 = ~Have you no instincts? Do you serve the Order without your heart's guidance? Bah, I have no time for doubters. Be swift and bring my goddaughter.~
@38091 = ~Have you no instincts? Do you serve the Order without your heart's guidance? Bah, I have no time for doubters. Be swift and bring my goddaughter.~
@38092 = ~Well? Is she coming down or is she not? I do not have all night to waste.~
@38093 = ~Well? Is she coming down or is she not? I do not have all night to waste.~
@38094 = ~What now? Is he finally here? Can I go?~
@38095 = ~Yes, he is here. Go downstairs and he shall take custody of you.~
@38096 = ~Wandering Horror~
@38097 = ~He is, though I would appreciate it if you could positively identify him for me.~
@38098 = ~At last. His place will be little better, but at least I'll be away from the Order. What a bunch of stiffs.~
@38099 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger... I trust you have already been approached by the forest spirit? I am afraid there is little that I can do.~
@38100 = ~Figurine~
@38101 = ~The spirit spoke of Lord Igen Tombelthen of Athkatla. He claims an ancestor left a cache of mithral in the west... He intends to tear the land apart to find it.~
@38102 = ~We have lived in peace with the spirits of the forest... I am afraid what this lord might do. Do you... intend to stop him, my <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@38103 = ~I will do what I can, Minister.~
@38104 = ~I will cut him to ribbons if he doesn't stop this nonsense.~
@38105 = ~No, I have no intention of doing anything of the sort.~
@38106 = ~That is good... I am very relieved. Lord Igen is currently in the same area as those... that Shade Lord was earlier. I suggest you go quickly.~
@38107 = ~That is... a little more than I expected, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. But, I suppose you are correct... Lord Igen must be stopped, no matter what occurs.~
@38108 = ~But... be careful, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger. You must adhere to a code of conduct, no? I would not want you to become a fallen ranger on my account.~
@38109 = ~Go swiftly, then, and be safe... Lord Igen is in the land that the Shade Lord was in until recently... to the west.~
@38110 = ~But... you cannot simply stand idly by! You... you are a ranger, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! Have you... have you not already told this spirit you would do this?~
@38111 = ~Regardless, I intend to do nothing. And I never agreed to perform any duties for you, remember?~
@38112 = ~Very well... I will keep my word. This time.~
@38113 = ~Of course you are right, Minister... please forgive me.~
@38114 = ~As... as you say, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. The Lord Igen is in the lands to the west of here... in the area once occupied by that Shade Lord. Be... be careful.~
@38115 = ~Then... then you are unworthy to be the ranger of our village! By Mielikki, I've never seen a ranger of your sort! How you are not fallen is beyond me!~
@38116 = ~Go, then, and leave us be. The cabin is no longer yours, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. We will find another ranger who believes in their duty.~
@38117 = ~Go, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger! Go to the lands in the west and aid the forest spirit, as you have promised!~
@38118 = ~I am grateful, <CHARNAME>, that you sent away Lord Igen without bloodshed. I could not be more pleased than to have you as our ranger.~
@38119 = ~It is too bad you had to resort to violence with Lord Igen... but at least the sacred land of the forest spirit has been preserved. I am grateful, <CHARNAME>.~
@38120 = ~It is a relief to see you, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger... Delon is safe? We are in danger, <CHARNAME>. Ogrons have come down from the hills to attack the village.~
@38121 = ~Madulf has kept his promise and kept them from crossing the river, until now. I believe things go badly for the ogre, however...~
@38122 = ~We would already have been attacked... but that ogre, Madulf, and his followers drove the ogrons back briefly... although I fear things go badly for the ogre...~
@38123 = ~The ogron band is collected outside of the cave... on the north shore of the river. I beg of you, <CHARNAME>... please deal with this menace!~
@38124 = ~...he is trapped in a cave with one of our shepherd boys, Atta, who wandered into the area. Madulf scooped the boy up and took refuge in the cave.~
@38125 = ~The boy must be saved, <CHARNAME>... and Madulf must not die in vain! Please... deal with this menace, I beg you! Or we will all be forced to flee our village!~
@38126 = ~...the fighting has driven him back into a cave. Rescue him, <CHARNAME>, and deal with this menace... or the whole village must flee for our lives!~
@38127 = ~Yes, he is, but this is too convenient for my tastes. Something could be wrong.~
@38128 = ~I have no desire to fight ogrons... deal with this yourselves.~
@38129 = ~Very well, Minister... I will do what I can.~
@38130 = ~No, I killed the bastard. This was too easy, so I figured he was lying. ~
@38131 = ~But... but, <CHARNAME>! You are our ranger! You... you must help us out—we are in desperate need!~
@38132 = ~That's too bad. I'll be going now.~
@38133 = ~Farsight~
@38134 = ~Very well... I'll see what I can do.~

@38136 = ~I had to kill him. There was something about his manner that I did not trust.~
@38137 = ~Of course you are right, Minister. I will help, if I can.~
@38138 = ~The village would be grateful, <CHARNAME>... Go, then... the cave is on the north shore of the river. I... I do not know how many ogrons there are... Good luck.~
@38139 = ~How do I do that, hmm? I've haven't seen him since I was born. You're the protector here, so is it safe to go downstairs or not? Make up your mind.~
@38140 = ~I am most relieved! Go, <CHARNAME>... the cave is on the north shore of the river! I do not know how many ogrons there are, but I wish you well.~
@38141 = ~Look, I don't care about your "feelings." I just want to know if I can leave. I'm sick of this place. Now make up your mind; do I go downstairs or do I not?~
@38142 = ~I have no interest in fighting these ogrons, Minister.~
@38143 = ~I'm sure Madulf can handle himself. I'm not needed here.~
@38144 = ~Very well, Minister... I will help, if I can.~
@38145 = ~But... but <CHARNAME>, there is a boy whose life is in danger! And you are a ranger, are you not? How can you abandon us like this?~
@38146 = ~That's tough, isn't it? I'll be on my way.~
@38147 = ~*sigh* Very well, then... I'll see what I can do.~
@38148 = ~Of course you are right, Minister. I apologize. I will help, if I can.~
@38149 = ~I... I do not believe he can, <CHARNAME>. Please... a boy is in danger, and the ogre must not die for helping us. You are a ranger... will you not aid us?~
@38150 = ~Sorry, no can do.~
@38151 = ~Very well. I'll see what I can do.~
@38152 = ~Sorry, I have no interest in fighting ogrons, Minister.~
@38153 = ~I'm not about to rescue an ogre, Minister. Let him deal with it himself.~
@38154 = ~Very well... I will help, if I can.~
@38155 = ~But the ogre is in danger, <CHARNAME>... and he fought valiantly to aid us! You... you are a ranger? Have you less honor than an ogre? Will you not help us?~
@38156 = ~Yes, I am sure it is safe for you to go.~
@38157 = ~No, wait here a moment more.~
@38158 = ~Yes, I am sure it is safe for you to go.~
@38159 = ~No, wait here a moment more.~
@38160 = ~Very well, Minister... I will see what I can do.~
@38161 = ~Of course you are right, Minister... I apologize. I will help, if I can.~
@38162 = ~Fine! Just you be quick about it! I want to get out of here!~
@38163 = ~Sorry, I have better things to do.~
@38164 = ~Well? What's the hold up?!~
@38165 = ~I am sorry for the delay. It is safe for you to go now.~
@38166 = ~The cave is on the north side of the river, <CHARNAME>, not far to the northwest of here... you will find the ogrons there. Go quickly!~
@38167 = ~I cannot let you go while I am still unsure. I am sorry.~
@38168 = ~Shadow Thief~
@38169 = ~Brunson~
@38170 = ~I killed the bastard. There was something wrong about this, I just know it.~
@38171 = ~We are more than grateful for your handling of the ogrons, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger. No doubt they will think twice before coming again. I commend you, truly.~
@38172 = ~I had to kill him. I am certain that the situation was still unsafe. I did not trust him.~
@38173 = ~<CHARNAME>, we are in dire straits. Umar—or someone claiming to be her—has returned. She came several days ago, ordering all the villagers to leave at once.~
@38174 = ~We were unsure what to do. This... this sorceress shot great balls of black flame from her hands, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... and summoned demons to stand at her side.~
@38175 = ~What? That was your solution? You had better hope you are right, because if you aren't, you are going to be in sooo much trouble. ~
@38176 = ~Everyone was so frightened... This Umar then shouted with a great booming voice, saying she was reclaiming her land and that we were trespassers...~
@38177 = ~She has given us only a few days, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. A few days to leave forever, or she will kill us. You... you will help us, yes?~
@38178 = ~Be that as it may, you are still safest staying here. My relief will arrive soon.~
@38179 = ~I did what was best. I know this in my heart. I am certain. Stay here while I report of this.~
@38180 = ~Sorry, Minister, but this isn't my fight.~
@38181 = ~What kind of reward might I be looking at for this?~
@38182 = ~*sigh* I wonder how long I'll have to live like this? Well... all the assassins are dead now, no matter what you've done. I know how they work. You should probably go back to the Order and report this... I'd rather be alone.~
@38183 = ~I'll do what I can... where can this supposed "Umar" be found?~
@38184 = ~But you are a ranger, <CHARNAME>... you are our protector. How can you abandon us now? We cannot fight a force such as this!~
@38185 = ~I cannot keep coming to your rescue, Minister. You'll just have to deal with it.~
@38186 = ~Well, I might change my mind with a reward...~
@38187 = ~You are right, Minister. I will help, of course. Where can I find this sorceress?~
@38188 = ~A... a reward? Did you become a ranger to become rich, <CHARNAME>? You have a duty! Will you abandon us now and leave us to face this witch?~
@38189 = ~I will, unless you can cough up some kind of reward.~
@38190 = ~I suppose you're right... I'll see what I can do. Where is this "Umar"?~
@38191 = ~Of course not... I'm sorry, Minister. Where can I find this sorceress?~
@38192 = ~Shepherds followed her to the lands in the west. She... went into the dungeon where you found the Shade Lord. That is where you should start.~
@38193 = ~I am grateful for your aid, <CHARNAME>... I trust the gods will look out for you... and Imnesvale... once again.~
@38194 = ~Sure, sure. My father was certain too that his enemies wouldn't stoop to this. Well, whatever. I know how these assassins work... they're not coming back. Go back to the Order and report whatever you have to. I will be fine.~
@38195 = ~There is not much time, <CHARNAME>! Please... go to the dungeon in the west, where you found the Shade Lord, and stop her before she carries out her threat!~
@38196 = ~I'll be fine. There won't be any more assassins tonight. You've done your job and then some, so get lost. Maybe you killed my real uncle and they'll hang you... that would be worth seeing.~
@38197 = ~You have saved my village time after time, <CHARNAME>. You are welcome to the cabin, and we are proud to have you as our ranger.~
@38198 = ~I will go get her directly. Sorry to have kept you waiting.~
@38199 = ~Are you certain you have no proof of your identity? ~
@38200 = ~I do not trust you, and I will not turn her over to you.~
@38201 = ~Despite all that you have done for us, <CHARNAME>, you are not worthy of your ranger status.~
@38202 = ~I will go get her directly. Sorry to have kept you waiting.~
@38203 = ~Are you certain you have no proof of your identity? ~
@38204 = ~I do not trust you, and I will not turn her over to you.~
@38205 = ~Not at all. I would be cautious as well, but I would also carry out my duty with all haste.~
@38206 = ~Not at all. I would be cautious as well, but I would also carry out my duty with all haste.~
@38207 = ~I need no proof of who I am, for I already know. Look, either go and get her or state that you will not, but be prepared to endure the consequences!~
@38208 = ~I need no proof of who I am, for I already know. Look, either go and get her or state that you will not, but be prepared to endure the consequences!~
@38209 = ~Are disobeying the direct orders of your superiors? Are you refusing your duty? Consider your next words. I will fight to take charge of my goddaughter!~
@38210 = ~Are disobeying the direct orders of your superiors? Are you refusing your duty? Consider your next words. I will fight to take charge of my goddaughter!~
@38211 = ~I will go and fetch her directly. Sorry for the delay.~
@38212 = ~I do not trust you or this situation!~
@38213 = ~I will go and fetch her directly. Sorry for the delay.~
@38214 = ~I do not trust you or this situation!~
@38215 = ~I will go and get her directly. Forgive my obstinate nature, but I had to be sure.~
@38216 = ~I do not trust you. I choose to fight, and I will deal with the consequences later!~
@38217 = ~So be it! You will die in shame!~
@38218 = ~I will go and get her directly. Forgive my obstinate nature, but I had to be sure.~
@38219 = ~I do not trust you. I choose to fight, and I will deal with the consequences later!~
@38220 = ~So be it! You will die in shame!~
@38221 = ~I thank you for what you have done here. I have been served well and will say so to your superiors. Tyrianna will be safe; you can be sure of that.~
@38222 = ~I thank you for what you have done here. I have been served well and will say so to your superiors. Tyrianna will be safe; you can be sure of that.~
@38223 = ~You there... you are the <PRO_RACE> who has become the ranger for this place? My name is Mairyn... I am a spirit of this forest, and I am in desperate need of your aid!~
@38224 = ~This has been a confusing matter with the Morningale family, one that bears close examination.~
@38225 = ~There are... other humans... in my sacred lands to the north of this place where the temple of the sun god once stood. They have come recently, digging and tearing down the trees...~
@38226 = ~I have begged them to stop, good ranger... I have pleaded with them that they are destroying not only me, but many of the other forest spirits as well. The humans have refused.~
@38227 = ~I implore you... go to the forest in the north and do whatever you can to stop these humans from further desecrating my forest!~
@38228 = ~We were lucky. He did not say at the time, but Hurgis informed us after that a group intent on delaying him had confronted him. That was why he was so curt with you.~
@38229 = ~It is quite evident that you saw no trouble, but that changes nothing. You failed, and the girl is dead. The man you handed her over to was NOT Hurgis Baltezan!~
@38230 = ~And we are baffled as to how you could have made such a mistake! You have killed one of the most respected servants of Torm in the realms! ~
@38231 = ~And you are to be commended. The real Hurgis contacted us and said that he had been ambushed and delayed. No doubt the assassins hoped to fool you.~
@38232 = ~I realize the odds were against you, but that is your lot: to fight the odds and win for justice. I am sorry, but I must rescue the reputation of the Order.~
@38233 = ~More than that, you have lost the favor of the gods. Your status as paladin is gone, as are the benefits. I can only imagine what happened to cause this.~
@38234 = ~I cannot imagine what happened under your watch. I am told that Tyrianna and Hurgis are dead? Is there an excuse that could possibly justify this?~
@38235 = ~What has happened. <CHARNAME>? I am told that the child is dead and that an imposter of Hurgis Baltezan was also found killed.~
@38236 = ~I have no interest in doing this. Find another to aid you.~
@38237 = ~Who are these people? Why are they doing this?~
@38238 = ~What kind of reward are you offering for my help?~
@38239 = ~Very well, Mairyn... I will do what I can to help.~
@38240 = ~I delivered the child to her godparent just as was planned. I see no trouble.~
@38241 = ~I delivered the child to her godparent just as was planned. I see no trouble.~
@38242 = ~No interest? You are a ranger, are you not? You are a defender of the wild... and I am in desperate need of your assistance. Will you turn your back on me, ranger?~
@38243 = ~I will. As I said, find another to help you.~
@38244 = ~You are right... I will help you, if I can.~
@38245 = ~Perhaps if there were some kind of reward, I might be more inclined to help you out.~
@38246 = ~I know not who these humans are... they claim, however, to be searching for something. Something I do not know the location of. They... threatened me, ranger. I was forced to flee.~
@38247 = ~You must go to them, and seek out the nature of their quest, if you wish. Whatever you do, however, you must stop them.~
@38248 = ~I have no interest in doing this. Find another to help you.~
@38249 = ~What might the reward be for doing this?~
@38250 = ~Very well... I will go and help you, if I can.~
@38251 = ~Reward? You are the first ranger I have heard of who has desired something in compensation for <PRO_HISHER> duty. I... I have nothing to offer you, ranger, other than my gratitude.~
@38252 = ~Then you are on your own.~
@38253 = ~Very well... I will see what I can do.~
@38254 = ~I ask nothing more of you. Go to the forest near here, with the shadowy ruins of human origin... there you will find the humans and their many tools. Go, I beg you, and stop them.~
@38255 = ~Then you are not worthy of your station. This village has chosen unwisely in replacing the human who protected here before you.~
@38256 = ~I will tell them of their mistake... and I will deal with the humans in the west as best I can. Go, unworthy ranger... go and be a simple warrior or mercenary, if you must. The forest needs not one such as you.~
@38257 = ~I shall wait by your cabin for you to bring word of what has occurred. May Mielikki shine on you, good ranger.~
@38258 = ~I... I sense that the humans yet continue their desecration of my sacred forest. What is it, good ranger? Is there a problem?~
@38259 = ~I talked to the noble, Lord Igen, and he refuses to stop.~
@38260 = ~I have agreed to find what the noble, Lord Igen, was looking for... but I cannot seem to find it.~
@38261 = ~There is no problem, Mairyn... I will continue trying.~
@38262 = ~Yes, there is. I cannot make the lord stop his search... I can do nothing more to help you.~
@38263 = ~Yes, there is. I have changed my mind... I do not have the time to help you.~
@38264 = ~All turned out well, though he said it was mere fortune that got him to the house. Things could have been very different, <CHARNAME>.~
@38265 = ~Tyrianna is safe, and she will be a symbol to those that strive against slavery... even if she is perhaps not the best voice. We all have our duty, though.~
@38266 = ~You are free to pursue your own goals for a time. The Order requires no more service from you just yet and rewards you with a suit of powerful armor for all that you have done so far. Carry on with your good works, <CHARNAME>.~
@38267 = ~Nothing to report to you just yet, though you are always welcome in this hall.~ [DEMSON06]
@38268 = ~But how is this possible? You said he would arrive!~
@38269 = ~He had proper bearing and authority. Nothing indicated he was not who he said!~
@38270 = ~The real Hurgis was delayed by an ambush. Evidently, the assassins replaced him. You met an imposter. You gave the child to an imposter.~
@38271 = ~She was found just outside the city. You have failed, <CHARNAME>. You have failed.~
@38272 = ~This is very frustrating! What else could have been done?!~
@38273 = ~But there was nothing amiss! I don't understand how this happened!~
@38274 = ~We were chosen for this because as paladins, we have an affinity for detecting evil. You failed. It grieves me, but I must take steps to ease public opinion.~
@38275 = ~But you must find a way to stop him, ranger... you must! He cannot continue his actions! He gives no thought to the consequence of what he does!~
@38276 = ~I killed that imposter, Hurgis. Simple as that. I did not trust his hostile manner.~
@38277 = ~I will not harm him, Mairyn... and I cannot help you.~
@38278 = ~Very well... I will keep on trying.~
@38279 = ~What is it that this human lord seeks?~
@38280 = ~He seeks a cache of mithral hidden by an ancestor... but he has only half of the directions to where it lays.~
@38281 = ~I do not know where this human might find this mithral. I truly do not. I might suggest that you look to the human temple beneath the ground... the place where you yourself banished the shadows.~
@38282 = ~But this is not possible. He was confrontational! He was suspicious!~
@38283 = ~How can this be? I was certain of this!~
@38284 = ~Perhaps you might find what you seek there... I cannot say for certain.~
@38285 = ~Mielikki bless you, good ranger... I will continue to wait here.~
@38286 = ~You were wrong, and I don't really know what to do. It was your job to protect the last of the Morningales, and instead you have snuffed out a great light.~
@38287 = ~You do not take your duties very seriously, for a ranger, <PRO_RACE>. You have sworn to uphold your tenets, have you not? I implore you to think again, to help one in need that falls under your charge!~
@38288 = ~Very well... I will try again.~
@38289 = ~Sorry, but you're on your own, Mairyn.~
@38290 = ~You were chosen for this because as a paladin, you have an affinity for detecting evil. Certainly there was none within Hurgis. I must take steps, <CHARNAME>.~
@38291 = ~I already sense that the violation of my forest has ceased, good ranger. I... I am sorry that it had to come to violence. You have protected your charge nevertheless, and I am grateful.~
@38292 = ~I will return to my home now and thank Mielikki that one who is true to her service has taken up a station here... that justice is upheld in this woodland. Bless you, good ranger.~
@38293 = ~I killed that imposter, Hurgis. Simple as that. I did not trust his hostile manner.~
@38294 = ~You successfully detected the evil they were trying to perpetrate, and for that you have earned the respect of your peers and the community. ~
@38295 = ~No need to say another word. I have failed in this, I know.~
@38296 = ~I already sense that the violation of my forest has ceased, good ranger. You have chosen your course wisely, and you have protected your charge. I am most grateful.~
@38297 = ~I will speak to the ranger and no other, <RACE>.~
@38298 = ~Hurgis demands your head, but his word is not law here. No, you have earned a more humane reward, though perhaps it is no less painful.~
@38299 = ~Good ranger... it is I, Mairyn, and once again I must ask you for help. The witch who has threatened your village... her dark and foul magics have also begun to poison the woodland! You must do something!~
@38300 = ~I cannot offer an excuse for what happened. The child is dead.~
@38301 = ~The child is dead, and you are disgraced. I hope the two are not linked; that would be monstrous. I will take what action I can and leave your soul to karma.~
@38302 = ~Threatened the village? What are you talking about?~
@38303 = ~Brunson~
@38304 = ~Sorry, but I have no time to help you.~
@38305 = ~Very well... I will seek her out and stop her.~
@38306 = ~I didn't trust Hurgis, and the child was a spoiled brat not worth my time.~
@38307 = ~He was not to be trusted, I know it! The girl was an unfortunate happenstance.~
@38308 = ~Pardo~
@38309 = ~Yes, I already know of her... I will do what I can, Mairyn.~
@38310 = ~Do you claim the moral high ground for these actions? Your audacity clinches what must be done! Get out of my sight! Return at your peril!~
@38311 = ~I did not trust that Hurgis fellow, so I killed him. I cannot explain the girl.~
@38312 = ~I killed them both. He was not to be trusted, and she was a spoiled brat.~
@38313 = ~Yes... well... The Hurgis imposter... killed her. Yes, that's it. Then I killed him. Yeah.~
@38314 = ~Certainly a great evil was committed today, but not from where we expected. Leave and never return. Only your previous service has stayed your execution.~
@38315 = ~You are lying, of course. Did you think a house of paladins could not detect it? The child is dead by your hand, or by those under you; it makes no difference.~
@38316 = ~You do not know? A witch has come into the area very recently... a human witch... and she has threatened your village with her magic. Either they leave... or she will kill them.~
@38317 = ~Already she gathers her dark powers in the buried human temple... that place where you destroyed the Shade Lord. Her magic seeps into the earth and poisons it with evil.~
@38318 = ~You must stop this creature, good ranger. Save your village and the forest both.~
@38319 = ~Sorry, but I have no time to do this.~
@38320 = ~I must go to Imnesvale and see what has occurred there.~
@38321 = ~Very well, I will stop this witch now.~
@38322 = ~You refuse to help me? And you refuse to aid the village you have been sworn to defend? How is it that you are a ranger and yet will turn your back on the helpless? Would you truly do this?~
@38323 = ~Yes, as I said... I have more important things to do.~
@38324 = ~Very well... I will see what I can do. But I must go to Imnesvale first.~
@38325 = ~Very well, I will see what I can do.~
@38326 = ~Do so, ranger! Go into the dungeon below and seek her out. I will wait here for you.~
@38327 = ~She lies below, good ranger, and the need is most urgent... but if you must go to your village first, then do so quickly. I will wait here for you.~
@38328 = ~Please, good ranger! Do not give up yet! This sorceress must be stopped!~
@38329 = ~I sense that the sorceress is dead... the foul presences she has conjured have ceased. You have done well, good ranger.~
@38330 = ~You have served the natural order with honor and strength, good ranger. I... I have something to give you. It is a present from Mielikki, a most rare thing...~
@38331 = ~...an idol of the moon dog to help when you struggle. Take it, <PRO_RACE>, and be thankful that a goddess smiles upon you.~
@38332 = ~Oh! There you are, my <PRO_LADYLORD> ranger! I... I've been looking all over the place for you! You... you've got to come to Imnesvale!~
@38333 = ~Why? What is occurring there?~
@38334 = ~I have no time for any side trips.~
@38335 = ~There's orcs... big ones! Nelleck says he saw them coming down from the hills. Soon they'll attack! The minister sent me to find you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>!~
@38336 = ~I'll be there as soon as I can, then.~
@38337 = ~I have no time to go to Imnesvale, I'm afraid.~
@38338 = ~Tell them to find someone else to deal with it... it's not my problem.~
@38339 = ~But... but you're a ranger! You're the protector that replaced Merella, aren't you? You've got to come! We've got nobody else to turn to!~
@38340 = ~Oh, please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! Please! Everyone's so scared that they're going to have to flee the village! I... I thought rangers were supposed to help people...~
@38341 = ~Madulf... he said he would do what he can, but Nelleck says there's too many! Oh please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! Please! I... I thought rangers were supposed to help people...~
@38342 = ~Nelleck says that they'll be at the village soon... no later than three or four days from now. You've got to hurry!~
@38343 = ~I'll run back and tell Minister Lloyd that you're coming! Everyone will be so relieved!~
@38344 = ~I do help people. I simply have something more important to do right now.~
@38345 = ~You heard wrong, boy. Now get lost.~
@38346 = ~Perhaps you are right. What is going on in the village, exactly?~
@38347 = ~Very well. I'll be at Imnesvale as soon as I can, then.~
@38348 = ~I do help people. I simply have something more important to do right now.~
@38349 = ~You heard wrong, boy. Now get lost.~
@38350 = ~Perhaps you are right. What is going on in the village, exactly?~
@38351 = ~Very well. I'll be at Imnesvale as soon as I can, then.~
@38352 = ~What... what could be more important than this?! Oooh... Nelleck says that the orcs will be on us within four days at the most... maybe less...~
@38353 = ~...I... I'll go an' tell Minister Lloyd that you may not be coming. I do so hope you change your mind, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! I was sure you would help us...~
@38354 = ~If you... if you change your mind... please hurry...~
@38355 = ~I... I thought rangers were good people... that they protected people. I... I can't believe you won't help us anymore...~
@38356 = ~Orcs... big ones... are comin' down from the hills. Nelleck saw 'em, and the minister sent me to find you. They'll be at the village in four days... maybe less!~
@38357 = ~Madulf says he'll help, but Nelleck says there's too many... even for him and those other creatures of his. The minister says you should come quickly, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@38358 = ~We haven't got anyone t' turn to, except you. And... and you replaced Merella, right? You'll come, then, right?~
@38359 = ~I... I've found you again, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! It's... it's so hard to find you sometimes! The... the village is in danger again! The minister has asked for you!~
@38360 = ~What's going on there now?~
@38361 = ~Go and tell the minister I will be there right away.~
@38362 = ~Sorry, I don't have time to help.~
@38363 = ~It's Umar! The witch! She's come back, and she's threatened to kill everyone if they don't go an' leave right now! The... the minister says he will tell you everything!~
@38364 = ~Umar? Very well, go and tell the minister I will be there as soon as I can.~
@38365 = ~I don't have time for this. Tell him to find someone else.~
@38366 = ~Okay! I'll go right now! Hurry, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, there isn't much time!~
@38367 = ~Don't have time? But... but you helped us fight those orcs... and you saved us all before that. Why... why would you abandon us now? I thought you were a ranger...~
@38368 = ~I am a ranger. Now go.~
@38369 = ~Perhaps you are right... what is happening in the village?~
@38370 = ~Very well. Go and tell the minister I will be there as soon as I can.~
@38371 = ~I... I can't believe you won't help us. If you... if you change your mind, please come and help! I don't think we can fight this...~
@38372 = ~It's Umar! The witch! She's come back, and she's threatened to kill everyone if they don't go an' leave right now! The... the minister says he will tell you everything!~
@38373 = ~I'll go and tell him that you're going to come, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! You must hurry!~
@38374 = ~Yes? You look like one of the locals, my good <MANWOMAN>. Is there something that you need?~
@38375 = ~What exactly are you looking for here?~
@38376 = ~You've got to stop all this digging and destruction that you are causing here.~
@38377 = ~Who are you, anyway?~
@38378 = ~No, I'll be on my way.~
@38379 = ~Ah, yes, you've noticed my little crew, have you? Yes, well, it's a rather long story, and I'd rather not get into it. Time for you to be on your way, peasant, as we have much to do here.~
@38380 = ~Well, what you're doing is destroying the forest... You have to stop.~
@38381 = ~Just who are you, anyway?~
@38382 = ~I'll not be spoken down to. I suggest you mend your manners, sir, before I get angry.~
@38383 = ~Very well, I will be on my way.~
@38384 = ~I'll do no such thing. I'll have you know that much of this land here is owned by my family. At least technically. And I'll tear every tree and rock in this area up until I find what I'm looking for.~
@38385 = ~Which is?~
@38386 = ~You'll not do that while I'm here, you won't.~
@38387 = ~Is there nothing that can dissuade you from this?~
@38388 = ~Very well, I'll be going, then.~
@38389 = ~I am Lord Igen Tombelthen, one of the last of a very prestigious and wealthy Amnian family. And since you are obviously a commoner, I would be pleased if you would just move along now.~
@38390 = ~Sorry, but I'm here to stop you from all this digging and destruction you're causing.~
@38391 = ~What exactly are you looking for here?~
@38392 = ~Very well, I'll be going, then.~
@38393 = ~Very well, then... off you go, peasant.~
@38394 = ~And I suggest you mind your station before I'm the one who gets angry. Speak your business, peasant, and be done with it.~
@38395 = ~You must stop all this damage and desecration you're causing here.~
@38396 = ~Forget it. I'll be going.~
@38397 = ~I do not think it is any of your affair. This is my land, and if I want to burn every tree here and slaughter every bear and squirrel, I will do so. I care not for your concerns, so begone.~
@38398 = ~I'm sorry, but I cannot allow you to do that.~
@38399 = ~Is there nothing that can persuade you to stop?~
@38400 = ~Very well, I'll be going, then.~
@38401 = ~And what, exactly, do you intend to do about it?~
@38402 = ~I am warning you... your life is forfeit if you continue this desecration.~
@38403 = ~I would prefer a peaceful resolution. Is there nothing that can convince you to stop?~
@38404 = ~There is not. I will stay until I find what I am looking for, and I will not depart a moment sooner. Your sorry concern for this overgrown patch of trees and monsters means nothing to me.~
@38405 = ~If I found this thing for you, would you leave?~
@38406 = ~That is not acceptable. Not while I'm here.~
@38407 = ~As you wish. I will be going, then.~
@38408 = ~You're not going to continue what you're doing... I'm here to see to that.~
@38409 = ~And yours will be forfeit if you continue this blatant hostility. Another careless word from you, commoner, and I'll be wearing your tongue as a souvenir.~
@38410 = ~That's too bad. Time for you to die, then.~
@38411 = ~This doesn't need to happen. Is there nothing that will persuade you to desist?~
@38412 = ~Hmmm. I might at that. It would certainly save me a great deal of trouble... and spare me the danger of facing the monsters here. Are you serious about this, woods<PRO_MANWOMAN>?~
@38413 = ~I am, so long as you stop your destruction.~
@38414 = ~No, I am not about to do your work for you, I think.~
@38415 = ~No... I doubt you would keep your deal anyway. It would be far better to kill you now.~
@38416 = ~Spoken like the usual dishonorable commoner. As you wish, then. Men! Take <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@38417 = ~I am willing to put off the search... at least for a while, to give you time to look for it. I'm sure my men will be glad of the break, at any rate... and it really costs me nothing.~
@38418 = ~You are a ranger, aren't you? I should have guessed from the attitude and the clothing. Very well then, ranger. I will leave here forever, if you find what I am looking for. You have my word. ~
@38419 = ~But I suppose some explanation is in order here, is it not?~
@38420 = ~I recently came across part of a journal belonging to an ancestor of mine, Idras Tombelthen. It was his fool notion to buy this land, back when there was mithral here.~
@38421 = ~He was not alone back then. Many nobles came... and there was not enough for all, certainly. I had always assumed that Idras had found nothing, but his journal suggests otherwise.~
@38422 = ~He mentions that he hid a cache of mithral here, away from the eyes of bandits. This was before he died, I assume, which is why he never brought it out again.~
@38423 = ~The part of the journal I have only mentions this area in general... nothing specific. Hence the large search I have undertaken. Here... I have a copy that was printed out. You may need it.~
@38424 = ~The other half of his journal may be around here... I certainly couldn't say where it might be, though, and I'm not about to waste effort looking for it.~
@38425 = ~So... there you have it, ranger. My men will set up camp here, and we will give you some time to search. It means little to me, but for your sake, I wish you well.~
@38426 = ~Then you might have spared me your insolence sooner. Away with you, foolish little <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@38427 = ~You're a Tombelthen? Well, perhaps this medallion belongs to you, then. I found it with this note not far from here.~
@38428 = ~You're a Tombelthen? Well, perhaps this medallion belongs to you, then. I found it with a note penned by an Idras Tombelthen not far from here. Apparently, this was all the mithral he could find here.~
@38429 = ~What? Let me see that note...~
@38430 = ~...I see. So this medallion is the sum of all he found? The fool! Ahhh, then this whole expedition has been a waste. It cannot be that valuable that all this effort has been worth it.~
@38431 = ~Very well then, ranger. That medallion is rightfully mine, but I'm willing to reward you for your effort. I'll give you 1,000 gold for it, and then I'll not disturb your precious forest any longer.~
@38432 = ~This was not easily come by. I will sell it to you for 2,000 gold, no less.~
@38433 = ~This was not easily come by. I will sell it to you for 2,000 gold, no less.~
@38434 = ~Very well... 1,000 gold and your departure is enough for me.~
@38435 = ~It is yours by right, Lord Igen. Take it and leave.~
@38436 = ~I would prefer to hang onto it, actually... it might be worth more than you say.~
@38437 = ~I might remind you, commoner, that the medallion is mine by right. And I do not have such coin as you ask. 1,000 gold, no more.~
@38438 = ~Very well, 1,000 gold and your departure will be enough for me.~
@38439 = ~I suppose I do not need your coin... it is yours by right, as you say. Take it and leave, then.~
@38440 = ~Sorry... 2,000 or you don't get it.~
@38441 = ~Do not test my patience, peasant. It is mine by right, and I will not be trifled with. I will give you 500 gold... and do not presume to bargain with me further.~
@38442 = ~500? Now you're insulting me. Forget it.~
@38443 = ~Perhaps you are right. 500 it is... so long as you leave as well.~
@38444 = ~I do not need your coin, at any rate. It is yours, as you say. Take it and go.~
@38445 = ~Aye. I am a man of my word, ranger. I have found what I desired... such as it is... and I shall go. Come, men... we are returning to the city.~
@38446 = ~You are generous, then. I see the rangers are as noble as their reputation. Very well, then... I am also a man of my word. Come, men... we return to the city.~
@38447 = ~I warn you, peasant. That is my property... and I shall use force, if necessary, to take it from you. I offer 500 gold... accept or face the consequences.~
@38448 = ~If that's the way you're going to be, you're not going to get it at all.~
@38449 = ~I've no desire for trouble... 500 it is.~
@38450 = ~Never mind, Lord Igen... I've no need for your coin. It's yours, as you said. Take it and go.~
@38451 = ~So be it. Men! Take <PRO_HIMHER>!~
@38452 = ~You again? What is it that you want now, woods<PRO_MANWOMAN>? My patience with your disruptions wears thin.~
@38453 = ~Hmmm... a commoner <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Away with you... I doubt we have any business, the two of us.~
@38454 = ~I demand to know what you're looking for.~
@38455 = ~Pardo~
@38456 = ~Is there nothing that will convince you to stop this desecration?~
@38457 = ~The rituals of ascension still rule here. Cernd will challenge you for leadership.~
@38458 = ~That's too bad... you will not continue this desecration so long as I am here.~
@38459 = ~Just who are you, anyway?~
@38460 = ~Nothing... I'll be on my way.~
@38461 = ~Moreno~
@38462 = ~I will speak for myself! Faldorn, for crimes upon this grove and her surrounding peoples, I challenge you! By the rites laid down ages ago, you cannot refuse!~
@38463 = ~Why would I refuse? I took this grove by force, and I shall keep it. Did you think I would retreat? Oh no, Cernd, this is your end. Prepare!~
@38464 = ~Well, how is it with you then, ranger? Have you found Idras's store of mithral?~
@38465 = ~I found this medallion, along with this note from Idras. Apparently, this is all you've been searching for.~
@38466 = ~I found this medallion, along with a note from Idras. Apparently, he didn't have much luck... he used all his mithral to make this.~
@38467 = ~I haven't... but I have found the other half of Idras's journal here. Will you accept that instead?~
@38468 = ~Not yet, but I intend to keep looking.~
@38469 = ~No... and I have decided not to continue looking.~
@38470 = ~It doesn't matter... I doubt you can be trusted anyway. It is better to kill you now.~
@38471 = ~Certainly not. I do not know where you got those writings, ranger... they might not even be authentic. And even if they are... use them to find the cache yourself.~
@38472 = ~I'm sorry, could you give me the long version of our history? It's like we just met.~
@38473 = ~After all... it is you who is so concerned about my men leaving tracks in your precious landscape, not I.~
@38474 = ~Oh, all right, but then we have to get going. It isn't safe here.~
@38475 = ~We lived at Candlekeep. It was the safest place, what with you having that Bhaal blood. You were with Gorion. I guess I came along later.~
@38476 = ~Very well, I will continue looking for your treasure.~
@38477 = ~Forget it, then... I am not about to continue this fool's errand.~
@38478 = ~I have my doubts as to whether you would even keep your word... Forget your task, noble. Killing you is the only option.~
@38479 = ~As you wish. You can look no better than I, I suppose... I shall continue to bide my time here. I'll even keep my men off the grass.~
@38480 = ~I think they let us stay because Gorion had powerful friends. I wish he had said where I was before that, but he thought it wasn't important, so I didn't worry too much. ~
@38481 = ~That is not good enough. You know too much about what I look for. In fact... you could already have found the cache and intend to keep it for yourself. Continue the search... or face the consequence.~
@38482 = ~Very well... I'll keep looking.~
@38483 = ~Forget it! You likely wouldn't keep your word anyway!~
@38484 = ~Do so... and return once you have it. And do not force me to come looking for you either, peasant...~
@38485 = ~Gorion was like a father, but I preferred old Winthrop. He was the innkeep, and he taught me about keeping out of sight and such.~
@38486 = ~We left when Sarevok killed Gorion. I was sorry I couldn't help, but we got him in the end. Remember that? That Sarevok turned out to be a child of Bhaal, like you? ~
@38487 = ~Anyway, now we're stuck in this place after getting captured by some creep that has been torturing us! Now, can we please go?~
@38488 = ~I am no one you need to concern yourself with, traveler. I am here to ensure the safety of Lord Igen, and that is all.~
@38489 = ~If you have business with Lord Igen, I suggest you talk to him.~
@38490 = ~You have agreed to undertake Lord Igen's search for him? Then you are foolish indeed. He will not stray from his quarry... and I doubt you have the ability to complete the task.~
@38491 = ~Can I trust you? I still don't really remember a thing.~
@38492 = ~Doing tests? Torturing? What do you mean?~
@38493 = ~All right, I'm moving. I ache all over though.~
@38494 = ~You have business with us? Speak to Lord Igen. Otherwise, leave me to do my work.~
@38495 = ~Don't mind the break here at all. You all just watch yourselves... any funny business with Lord Tombelthen and that'll be the end of you.~
@38496 = ~Youse must kill the ogrons, <RACE>! Lil human must be protected! Go an' kill ogrons... Madulf wounded. Madulf stay and protect lil human...~
@38497 = ~Youse must kill ogrons! Madulf try, but Madulf wounded... Madulf hold off ogrons from here. Go, <RACE>... kill ogrons! Protect human village!~
@38498 = ~Moreno~
@38499 = ~Franco~
@38500 = ~Franco~
@38501 = ~Ogrons dead? Youse done good, <RACE>. Youse kill all 'em ogrons good... Madulf try, but Madulf's friends get hurt and run. Then lil human came, and Madulf had to protect lil human.~
@38502 = ~Madulf pick up lil human and run for cave. Ogrons shoot arrows... hurt Madulf. Youse okay though, lil human? Youse not hurt?~
@38503 = ~Hurgis Baltezan~
@38504 = ~I... my name's Atta... and I'm fine, Mister Ogre, sir...~
@38505 = ~Hurgis Baltezan~
@38506 = ~That good. Then youse go home, if youse not hurt. Youse be careful, lil Atta...~
@38507 = ~...okay... um, thank you, Mister Ogre...~
@38508 = ~Squire Elotte~
@38509 = ~Squire Elotte~
@38510 = ~Madulf say he protect village, so he try kill ogrons. Ogrons very strong, though. Madulf kept word, though... Madulf hold ogrons back so ogrons no attack too soon. Youse get here just in time.~
@38511 = ~Madulf go now... Madulf must find his friends, see if friends dead or wounded, maybe. Madulf see now if humans in village be nicer to Madulf and friends.~
@38512 = ~Youse a good <RACE>... Madulf thanks you for saving Madulf.~
@38513 = ~Madulf knows Madulf never promise to protect village... but Madulf not watch village humans be hurt. Madulf and friends... we hold ogrons back. Youse get here just in time.~
@38514 = ~Ogrons dead? Youse done good, <RACE>. Youse kill all 'em ogrons good... Madulf try, but Madulf's friends get hurt and run into hills.~
@38515 = ~Madulf fight ogrons on own, but ogrons shoots arrows... arrows hurt Madulf, so Madulf run for cave.~
@38516 = ~Are... are all those bad monsters gone, <SIRMAAM>? I... I'm so scared...~
@38517 = ~What?! Blast! And here I thought scaring those poor fools with Umar's name would prevent them from sticking their noses here until I was done setting up my demesne.~
@38518 = ~Obviously, I was wrong. But I will not allow intruders here, fool! I claim this place! It's mine! Mine!~
@38519 = ~I am relieved, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! You have saved us again! And... that ogre, Madulf, saved Atta. I was surprised enough to see him protecting the village!~
@38520 = ~Maybe we were wrong about him and his... his followers. There may be a chance of an alliance... I will speak to him about it when I see him next.~

(Enchantment/Charm)

Sphere: Animal
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 hour
Area of Effect: 1 animal
Saving Throw: Neg.

By means of this spell, the caster is able to show any animal of animal intelligence to semi-intelligence (i.e. Intelligence 1d4) that <PRO_HESHE> desires friendship. If the animal does not roll a successful Save vs. Spell immediately when the spell is begun, it stands quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The spell functions only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster has ulterior motives, the animal always senses them (for example, if the caster intends to eat the animal, send it ahead to set off traps, etc.).

The caster can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet (i.e. they cannot be complex). Training for each such trick must be done over a period of one week, and all must be done within three months of acquiring the creature. During the three-month period, the animal will not harm the caster, but if the creature is left alone for more than a week, it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly.

The caster can use this spell to attract up to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience level <PRO_HESHE> possesses. This is also the maximum total Hit Dice of the animals that can be attracted and trained at one time: no more than twice the caster's experience level. Only unaligned animals can be attracted, befriended, and trained.~

Cloak of Fear empowers the caster to radiate a personal aura of fear out to a 3-ft. radius. All other characters and creatures within this aura must roll a successful Saving Throws vs. Spell or run away in panic for 4 rounds. Affected individuals may even drop items.

By casting this spell, the priest channels a bolt of divine energy against the target. No attack roll is needed. Creatures struck suffer varying damage, depending on their plane of origin:

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes a localized folding of space. The folded space takes the form of an invisible disk that protects the caster. Any missile weapon that intersects this disk is instantaneously reversed in direction. Melee factors such as speed, range, and damage are unaffected; the direction of the object or force is simply rotated through a 180-deg. arc. The sender of the missile finds <PRO_HIMHER>self the target of <PRO_HISHER> own attack. The caster of the mirror can direct missile attacks normally through the space occupied by the mirror.~

(Invocation)

Sphere: Sun
Level: 6
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

When the spell is completed, it creates a glowing stone. This gem must be immediately thrown at an opponent, for it quickly becomes too hot to hold. It is not possible for the priest to give the stone to another character to throw. The priest must make an attack roll with +3 bonus and no penalty for lack of weapon proficiency. In addition, the glowing gem can be used to strike any creature, even those hit only by magical weapons, although there is no damage bonus.

When it hits, the gem bursts with a brilliant, searing flash that causes 6d6 points of fire damage to the target and blinds <PRO_HIMHER> for 1d6 rounds. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Spell for half damage and to avoid being blinded. Undead creatures suffer 12d6 points of fire damage and are blinded for 12 rounds (if applicable) upon a failed Saving Throw; otherwise, they receive 9d6 points of damage and are blinded for 6 rounds.~

Area of Effect: Current area
Saving Throw: None

Zone of Sweet Air repels all noxious elements from poisonous vapors, including magically created vapors such as Cloudkill. This spell will dismiss all clouds in the entire area that the caster is currently in.

(Abjuration, Evocation)

Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 4 hrs. + ' hr./level
Casting Time: 1rd.
Area of Effect: Up to 20-ft. cube
Saving Throw: None

When an alarm spell is cast, the wizard causes a selected area to react to the presence of any creature larger than a normal rat—anything larger than about ' cubic foot in volume or more than about three pounds in weight. The area of effect can be a portal, a section of floor, stairs, etc. As soon as any creature enters the warded area, touches it, or otherwise contacts it without speaking a password established by the caster, the alarm spell lets out a loud ringing that can be heard clearly within a 60-ft. radius. (Reduce the radius by 10 ft. for each interposing door and by 20 ft. for each substantial interposing wall.) The sound lasts for one round and then ceases. Ethereal or astrally projected creatures do not trigger an alarm, but flying or levitating creatures, invisible creatures, or incorporeal or gaseous creatures do. The caster can dismiss the alarm with a single word.~
@38586 = ~Spook~
@38587 = ~Spook
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 1
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Spook spell enables the wizard to play upon natural fears to cause the target creature to perceive the caster as someone or something inimical, which then appears to advance upon it in a threatening manner. If the creature does not make a successful Save vs. Spell, it turns and flees at maximum speed as far from the wizard as possible. The creature suffers a Saving Throw penalty of -1 every 2 levels of the caster, up to a maximum of -6 at 12th level. Although the caster does not actually pursue the fleeing creature, a phantasm from its own mind does. Undead are completely unaffected.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates several small globes of fire, one for each experience level the wizard has obtained, which are held in the wizard's hands in place of <PRO_HISHER> usual weapons. The meteors can be hurled at targets up to 270 ft. away and are treated as missiles with a +5 bonus to the attack rolls. Each meteor bursts into a 1-ft. diameter sphere upon impact, inflicting 1d4+3 points of damage plus an additional 3 points of fire damage to any creature struck. The wizard can hurl up to five missiles per round.~

Range: 90 ft.
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell causes a major disease and weakness in a creature. The afflicted individual is immediately stricken with painful and distracting symptoms: boils, blotches, lesions, seeping abscesses, and so on. Strength, Dexterity, and Charisma scores are reduced by 2. The afflicted character is also Slowed. These effects persist until the character receives a Cure Disease spell.~

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Deafness spell causes the recipient to become totally unable to hear any sounds. The victim is allowed a Save vs. Spell to negate the effect. Deafened spellcasters have a 50% chance to miscast any spells. This deafness can be done away with by means of Dispel Magic or Cure Disease.~
@38594 = ~Glitterdust~

Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 4 rounds

Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. All enemies in the area must roll a successful Save vs. Spell or be blinded (-4 penalty to attack rolls and Armor Class) for 4 rounds. In addition, all enemies who fail their Saving Throw are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades, thus revealing invisible creatures. The dust fades in 4 rounds.~

@38597 = ~Wizard Eye
(Divination, Alteration)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the wizard creates an invisible sensory organ that sends <PRO_HIMHER> visual information. The Wizard Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of a Wizard Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.~
@38598 = ~Limited Wish~
@38599 = ~Are we? Horrible, horrible things surround us, and my head still hurts like crazy. I want to know what he did to me. I remember... something about potential.~
@38600 = ~Limited Wish
(Conjuration/Summoning, Invocation/Evocation)

Level: 7
Range: Unlimited
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

The Limited Wish is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The use of a Limited Wish will not substantially change major realities. The spell can, for example, restore some Hit Points lost by the wizard. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. Lastly, the wiser the wizard, the better chance that <PRO_HESHE> will choose the right wording. Wizards with low Wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~
@38601 = ~She can only be a vampire, and I suspect many of her servants are as well. The time has come to strike back to protect our people and the city she has invaded.~
@38602 = ~He said it about you too: something about power that can be unleashed. I don't care; I just have to get out. Can we leave this room? It bothers me.~
@38603 = ~I want to know what he did to me too. My head still hurts really bad. He said... said something about potential... about you too.~
@38604 = ~There you shall find a set of blue doors just north of a spider den. The doors are too heavy for any mortal to open, but the vampires likely pass with ease.~
@38605 = ~I shall send a mage to meet you there and arrange for the doors to be opened. Here, you shall need these stakes if you are to truly finish these creatures. ~
@38606 = ~Wow, a golem. Powerful magic stuff. Odd that it's not hostile. I suppose its maker didn't expect us to escape, so it never got orders for restraining us.~
@38607 = ~Prisoners... you must not escape... the master does not will it.~ [ZOMBI03]
@38608 = ~This flail has been in the care of Lord de'Arnise for some time, a relic of his adventuring youth. It has been kept disassembled, the individual pieces stored in separate locations, and only used in the direst of emergencies. Lord de'Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiated when compiled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt, the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity for magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, "losing" it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

@39042 = ~I'm sure ye're wondering just what Mitsu is doing amongst the Shadow Thieves. They don't have many halflings here, right? Well, that's true... but not many halflings take their thievery so seriously.~

@39052 = ~Don't let that Tassa order ya around none. She's just Aran's mistress... and while that means ya don't touch her and don't piss 'er off too much, it doesn't mean ya has to listen to her, s'right?~

@39055 = ~Hmmm... must be nigh on three months now. But I've been avoidin' Pelanna like the plague. She won't be convinced me trainin's done 'til I'm on me deathbed.~
@39056 = ~Ha! Really? Must be just you, Cuchul. Me, she leaves alone jus' fine. I runs the course only if I feels like it. Maybe some of our trainin's just more advanced than others', s'right?~
@39057 = ~Pfeh! Ye know 'tis just that the lovely sergeant has a thing for the Cuchul and little else, wee one.~
@39058 = ~I truly wish Aran would find another place fer Booter to tend his work. 'Tis a distraction when ye're trainin', listenin' to the screams and smellin' those bits he doesn't clean up.~

@39070 = ~Hah! You feel that your position is something that has some particular meaning or value? That it has any permanence beyond Aran's whim? Not likely, fool.~
@39071 = ~Aran's help? Aran's help is like his harm; there is little difference between the two, for the most part. He'll turn on you in a second if it amuses him, mark my words.~
@39072 = ~There's nothing you can say that will frighten me, little <MANWOMAN>. My fate here has been sealed by Aran himself. And I shall suffer much more than your disagreeable presence before I am allowed to die.~
@39073 = ~I am Achon... I was once Aran's lieutenant, his chief assistant and right-hand man. I was loyal to the guild above all, and that was my greatest fault. I thought I was doing the guild a favor by trying to assassinate Aran.~
@39074 = ~Perhaps I was right, perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps Aran will not destroy our guild. Perhaps the other guild run by that... that woman... will be eliminated. I suppose I shall never know.~
@39075 = ~The only thing I am certain of now is that my punishment shall be more agonizing and prolonged than anything you can dream of.~
@39076 = ~Now leave me be, newcomer. There is nothing you can do for me or to me, and I have nothing left but to await my fate at Aran's whim.~

@39084 = ~I don't suppose you even know why I'm here, do you? Aran sent me on a mission, and I failed him. *sigh* I tried my best, though, I really did. How did I know his nephew would die?~
@39085 = ~Aran sent me to sneak into a fort in Murann... bring someone who was there back out. I was the best, and he told me the mission was important. Just... just not how important, though.~
@39086 = ~I made it to the fort and even snuck inside under cover of midnight. I got fumbled in a gas trap, though. Didn't even see it coming. My lungs burned as I fought to stay conscious... but I lost.~
@39087 = ~Came to with some knight or other glaring down at me. They just threw me out, spouting some nonsense about honor or such. I wish now that they had just killed me.~
@39088 = ~You see... the one I was sent to retrieve was Aran's nephew. They had him prisoner there. And... and he was executed the next morning, by the time I stumbled back to the guild.~
@39089 = ~*sigh* If only I'd known. I never would have come back. Although I suppose they'd have found me eventually.~

@39101 = ~NO! NO, PLEASE! I'M BEGGING YOU! DON'T DO THIS!~
@39102 = ~Now, now, ye should have thought about that before you went and murdered your guild partners and their families. Now careful, your moving might cause real damage here, an' then where would I be?~

@39124 = ~Forget it, I've got other things to do.~

@39177 = ~By the pits of the Abyss! Ye've agreed to run off into th' bloody forest on the whinings of a whelp, have ye? Have ye lost yer senses? Bah!~
@39178 = ~There is nothing wrong with a noble task duly undertaken. And perhaps it will be enjoyable to see you in a greener setting, dwarf.~
@39179 = ~A medium shield is carried in the same manner as a small shield. Unlike the small shield, however, its weight prevents the character from using <PRO_HISHER> shield hand for anything other than carrying the medium shield. Medium shields are usually made of metal, range from three to four feet in diameter, and can be of any shape, from round to square to a dragon's spread wings. A typical medieval shield resembles a triangle with one point facing downward. This is a magical shield.

@39180 = ~Lovely, just lovely. If ye're plannin' this trip with that one, it be best if ye keeps us apart. I've an aching head already...~
@39181 = ~I hope you intend to go to this village soon, <GABBER>. A visit to greener lands would be welcome after our trek through this crowded city.~
@39182 = ~We shall go and save the village for the boy! I will crush the evil! All of the evil! Even the small, rodent-sized evil... although that is more Boo's job.~
@39183 = ~Greetings to you! I hope you have enjoyed your stay at the Ducal Palace.~ [TTBELT01]
@39184 = ~I'm sorry to hear that you wish to move on, but it's not a great surprise. A <PRO_MANWOMAN> of your profession would not be comfortable cooped up in a castle such as this.~
@39185 = ~But before you leave, it is my duty to make sure you are prepared for what awaits you in the world of Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition. ~
@39186 = ~Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition uses 2nd edition AD&D rules. This might seem overwhelming at first, but I will familiarize you with the basic rules and interface of the game.~
@39187 = ~We'll begin with the pause feature. Pause the game at any time with the SPACE BAR or by LEFT-CLICKING on the clock at the lower left of the screen.~
@39188 = ~Unpausing occurs the same way.~
@39189 = ~Pausing is most useful during combat where it gives you the time to carefully orchestrate your party's next attack. While paused, issue your commands.~
@39190 = ~When you unpause, your characters will carry out the orders you have given. If you do not use the SPACE BAR, you may find the game very difficult to play.~
@39191 = ~Why don't you experiment with pausing right now by using the SPACE BAR and giving your character some movement commands? When you have finished, LEFT-CLICK on me to resume our conversation.~
@39192 = ~My next topic is on how to differentiate enemies from people you want to talk to. Enemies have red circles; people you want to talk to have blue circles.~ [TTBELT05]
@39193 = ~Interaction with NPCs defaults to Talk for neutral targets and Attack for hostile ones. Talk to neutral characters (identified by blue circles), by LEFT-CLICKING on them.~
@39194 = ~To attack hostile NPCs, simply LEFT-CLICK on them. If you want to attack a neutral NPC, select a Weapon icon from the bottom of your screen and LEFT-CLICK on the target.~
@39195 = ~Let's test this out now. LEFT-CLICK on my servant and you will start a conversation. Servant Jospil! Come here at once.~
@39196 = ~Hey there! Wasn't that easy? What I'm going to do now is turn hostile. My circle will turn red, and then you can LEFT-CLICK on me to attack.~ [TTSER101]
@39197 = ~When you press the button, you hear a door slam open in the distance.~
@39198 = ~There is no point in pressing the button again.~
@39199 = ~All right then! Let's go... hit me if you can!~
@39200 = ~Well done! That was a good hit. Belt will talk with you now.~ [TTSER102]
@39201 = ~I now want to talk to you about the Inventory page.~ [TTBELT06]
@39202 = ~You can look at your Inventory page by RIGHT-CLICKING on your character portrait or by pressing the backpack icon on the left side of the screen (hotkey "I"). ~
@39203 = ~Take a quick look at your Inventory page. To get out of your Inventory page, simply press the return to game button at the top left of your screen (hotkey "G").~
@39204 = ~Equip items by placing them in the appropriate slots around your character on the Inventory age. ~ [TTBELT07]
@39205 = ~Once equipped, select the weapon by LEFT-CLICKING on the Quick Weapon slot at the bottom of the main gameplay screen. A green box will appear around the weapon that is in your character's hands; an orange box indicates combat mode.~
@39206 = ~I am going to give you a weapon now, and I want you to try and equip it.~
@39207 = ~You haven't equipped your weapon yet. Remember, just RIGHT-CLICK on your character portrait and you will find your weapon at the bottom of your screen in your Inventory.~
@39208 = ~Dedral~
@39209 = ~Dedral~
@39210 = ~Key to Aran's Lair~
@39211 = ~Shadow Thief Prison Key~
@39212 = ~LEFT-CLICK on the weapon and you will grab it with your cursor. Drag it over to the character doll and LEFT-CLICK again. You can also drag it to a specific slot on your character.~
@39213 = ~Good job! It's time for us to go upstairs now. Press on the stairway to go there.~ [TTBELT09]
@39214 = ~When your cursor changes, it means that you are about to perform an action other than moving.~
@39215 = ~If you LEFT-CLICK on the stairs, your character will walk over to the stairs and move up to the next level.~
@39216 = ~What's taking you so long? Go up the stairs.~ [TTBELT10]
@39217 = ~Now to the next part of your lesson: the Journal. I want you to check your Journal.~ [TTBELT11]
@39218 = ~To assist in recording important information, many details will automatically be entered in your Journal. To access the Journal, LEFT-CLICK the quill icon on the left side of the screen (or press the hotkey "J").~
@39219 = ~Entries are cataloged according to the story chapter in which you encountered them. They are also divided up into quests and main story entries. ~
@39220 = ~Main story entries will remain in your Journal forever, and they are a reminder of all of the major events in your character's life so far.~
@39221 = ~Quest entries are entered in your Journal when a quest begins and removed when the quest ends. The entry then appears in the Done Quests section.~
@39222 = ~If you check your Journal right now, you will notice that an entry has been placed to remind you to finish combat training. When your training is done, the entry will disappear.~
@39223 = ~All right then. Now your first combat lesson. My combat teacher, Brevin, is going to be coming right up the stairs. I want you to hit him with your staff, and then check your Journal.~ [TTBELT12]
@39224 = ~Good job! I want you to check your Journal and see how it has been updated. Check both the Quests and Journal buttons, as they will contain different kinds of information.~ [TTBELT13]
@39225 = ~Now I want you to check your Map screen. To access it, just click the Map icon on the left side of your screen. This will show a view of the area you are currently in.~ [TTBELT14]
@39226 = ~Intruders! Disable the guillotines! I need to come through!~
@39227 = ~Once on the Map screen, you will notice a World Map icon at the top right. LEFT-CLICKING this will take you to the world map, which displays all of the game areas you currently know about.~
@39228 = ~You may also annotate your Map screen by RIGHT-CLICKING where you want to make a note. Your cursor will change and you can type a short message to yourself.~
@39229 = ~You've walked right into our web, fool! Take no prisoners! We must protect Aran!~
@39230 = ~I'll give you a few seconds to try all of this out. Try placing a map note saying "Training level 2."~
@39231 = ~I can't believe the fools let you through! Ah well... if it takes a torturer to kill you, then so be it!~
@39232 = ~Another page you might be interested in is the character sheet. This can be accessed by clicking on the head icon on the left side of the screen.~ [TTBELT02]
@39233 = ~The Record sheet has everything you need to know about your character. You will also find an export button and an information button on this page.~
@39234 = ~You've been sent by Bodhi, haven't you? Kill that cursed torturer and free me! Booter has the keys! I'll tell you everything I know!~
@39235 = ~The Export button will export your character for use in a new game. This is NOT a save game, but rather a way of transferring a favorite character from game to game.~
@39236 = ~The Information screen shows your character's history and combat statistics.~
@39237 = ~The last icon that you need to know about is the Options icon. You can also find it on the left side of the screen. On the Options screen, you will be able to save and load games as well as modify graphics, sound, and gameplay.~ [TTBELT15]
@39238 = ~You've been sent by Bodhi, haven't you? Please let me out! I can help you penetrate Aran Linvail's defenses!~
@39239 = ~Praise Mask! Thank you for freeing me. My former guild isn't as friendly as I had hoped it would be.~
@39240 = ~Other characters can join you on your adventures. In fact, without companions, you will find Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition almost impossible to finish.~
@39241 = ~I will now introduce you to Xan, an elven mage. He will join your party and then show you how to memorize and cast spells.~
@39242 = ~Hello. I am Xan, a mage from Evereska in the north. I am going to join your party and show you how to cast and memorize spells.~ [TTXAN01]
@39243 = ~My first lesson for you is on how to cast spells.~ [TTXAN02]
@39244 = ~Select my (Xan's) Cast Spell button, choose a spell, and LEFT-CLICK on your target. My Cast Spell button is the Spell icon on the bottom of the screen. You need to have me (Xan) selected for you to have access to my spells.~
@39245 = ~You can also configure Quick Spells by RIGHT-CLICKING on a Quick Spell slot. This summons a list of memorized spells to choose. If no spells are listed, the character either does not have any spells memorized or cannot cast until higher levels.~
@39246 = ~To cast the Quick Spell, LEFT-CLICK on the appropriate Quick Spell slot and then select your target.~
@39247 = ~I want you to try and cast a spell now. Select any spell in your repertoire and cast it on Belt.~
@39248 = ~Tizzak~
@39249 = ~Tizzak~
@39250 = ~You must be the Tizzak that Bodhi mentioned.~
@39251 = ~You haven't cast a spell on Belt yet. Select my (Xan's) Cast Spell button, choose a spell, and LEFT-CLICK on your target.~ [TTXAN03]
@39252 = ~Good job! I am now going to teach you how to memorize spells.~ [TTXAN04]
@39253 = ~One more thing: Tizzak, an employee of mine, is missing, and the Thieves may have him. Find him, and he may tell you how to access Aran's sanctum. Go now!~
@39254 = ~Any spellcaster (besides Sorcerers) must memorize spells using the Rest button on the left panel after choosing their spells on the Mage Book or Priest Scroll pages. Select the Mage Book or Priest Scroll icon that appears on the left edge of the screen.~
@39255 = ~Choose the spells you want to memorize and then click on the Rest button. Once your rest is completed, you will have memorized all of your spells.~
@39256 = ~I want you to try and memorize some spells right now.~
@39257 = ~You haven't slept yet. You can access your Rest button from either your Memorization screen or your Inventory screen. Or the main screen.~ [TTXAN05]
@39258 = ~Tell me how to find Aran Linvail or I'll slit your throat!~
@39259 = ~Good job! I'm now going to teach you how to LEARN spells. I have a Flame Arrow scroll in my inventory.~ [TTXAN06]
@39260 = ~I am, and well met! I used to be a Shadow Thief until Bodhi recruited me. My loyalty only goes as far as the power of my employer goes. Bodhi has sent you to kill Aran Linvail?~
@39261 = ~Yes, she has. How can I get to his inner sanctum?~
@39262 = ~RIGHT-CLICK on the scroll and it will bring you to the Item History screen. On the bottom of the screen, you will find a button that says "Write Magic." Press this and your Mage (me) will now be able to cast Flame Arrow (once I memorize it, that is).~
@39263 = ~No more questions. I have to get my work done.~
@39264 = ~You haven't had me learn the spell yet. Remember, just RIGHT-CLICK on the scroll, then on the Write Magic button at the bottom of the Item History page.~ [TTXAN07]
@39265 = ~They will force this man to fight? Justice is cried for here, <GABBER>. We cannot sit idly and allow this to continue!~
@39266 = ~They're going to... they're going to make him fight a wild animal! Oh no! I d-don't think I can watch this... it's horrible!~
@39267 = ~Be calm! I want him dead as much as you do.~
@39268 = ~Good job. Now I'm going to teach you how to identify items. When you find a magical item, you won't automatically know what it does. To find out, you must first RIGHT-CLICK on the item.~ [TTXAN08]
@39269 = ~Aran's inner sanctum is protected by two magical doors. They can be neither picked nor bashed. You shall have to find a button for the first and a key for the second.~
@39270 = ~They throw this man into a pit with a wild beast? This is a crime against man AND nature! They will surely feel my wrath for this travesty!~
@39271 = ~On the bottom of the item's history screen, you will find a button labeled "Identify." LEFT-CLICK on this. If whoever has the item in their inventory has an Identify spell memorized or has an Identify scroll, then the item will be identified.~
@39272 = ~Bards and very intelligent characters can sometimes automatically identify an item when they pick it up.~
@39273 = ~The button can be found somewhere to the north, at the end of a heavily trapped hallway. ~
@39274 = ~I have an unidentified shield in my inventory. I also have an Identify spell memorized. I will give you a moment to try and identify the shield.~
@39275 = ~As to the key, I know not where it is, but I do know that Aran's most trusted advisor is a wizard called Haz. He might have a key if he is in the compound.~
@39276 = ~I am somewhat worse for wear, so I shall have to take my leave of you. Best of luck, and thanks for saving me.~
@39277 = ~It is good that you do not trust this piece of rabble, <GABBER>. He and his kin are not to be trusted, and we've no time to waste on them.~
@39278 = ~Have you no compassion for the weak, Anomen? I find this course of action most dishonorable... it leaves a dark taste in my mouth.~
@39279 = ~Have you no heart, knight? These are men with nothing! And we are in a position to help them!~
@39280 = ~They are desperate criminals, at the very least, who would trample us if they were actually set free. <GABBER> has the right of it.~
@39281 = ~If I may be so bold as to offer a bit of advice, I will tell you how to get to Aran.~
@39282 = ~You may wish to reconsider your refusal, <GABBER>. This may be a way to overcome the slavers here for good. It is the honorable path, if you are interested.~
@39283 = ~To the Abyss with the honorable path, druid. We've nae business here, an' <GABBER> knows it.~
@39284 = ~Aye... giving these destitute men their freedom is only the right thing to do. Are you sure we should not trust them?~
@39285 = ~Now that you know everything about using Mage spells, I'm going to introduce you to a Cleric. Her name is Branwen, and she'll be teaching you how to use Cleric abilities.~ [TTBELT16]
@39286 = ~I wondered if you might eventually drag yourself over to me. I'm afraid your Mistress Bodhi shall have to remain in her graveyard lair. Your little invasion shall end here and her plans with it!~
@39287 = ~I think it's the right thing to do, to free these people. I was... once something of a slave myself, locked away in a tiny cage. It... it isn't right.~
@39288 = ~We are going to free this warrior and his people? This is a task of great honor! We shall be great heroes for this, heroes doing heroic things for all to see!~
@39289 = ~Greetings and goodwill. I am Branwen, and I follow the ways of Tempus, god of war. I am going to join your party and teach you how to use Cleric abilities.~ [TTBRAN01]
@39290 = ~You cast Cleric spells in the exact same way that you cast Mage spells. I'll refresh your memory in case you've forgotten.~ [TTBRAN02]
@39291 = ~Select my Cast Spell button, choose a spell, and LEFT-CLICK on your target. My Cast Spell button is the spell icon on the bottom of the screen. You need to have me selected for you to have access to my spells.~
@39292 = ~I want you to cast a spell on Belt now. He is slightly wounded from the other spell you cast on him, so you should use one of my healing spells. Go ahead, cast a healing spell on Belt, or anyone else for that matter. (You can rest to restore a healing spell if necessary.)~
@39293 = ~You haven't cast a spell yet. Select my Cast Spell button, choose a spell, and LEFT-CLICK on your target. If you don't have a healing spell memorized, then you can rest to memorize it.~ [TTBRAN03]
@39294 = ~Good! Now I'll give you a short overview on how to memorize Cleric spells.~ [TTBRAN04]
@39295 = ~Any spellcaster (besides Sorcerers) must memorize spells using the Rest button on the left panel after choosing their spells on the Mage Book or Priest Scroll pages. Select the Mage Book or Priest Scroll icon that appears on the left edge of the screen.~
@39296 = ~Choose the spells you want to memorize and then LEFT-CLICK on the Rest button. Once your rest is completed, you will have memorized all of your spells.~
@39297 = ~I want you to try and memorize some spells right now.~
@39298 = ~You haven't slept yet. You can access your sleep button from either your Memorization screen or your Inventory screen.~ [TTBRAN05]
@39299 = ~Good job. (The spells you have selected will be rememorized each time you rest, replacing any you may have used.) Now, on to another ability. A very important skill to the Cleric class is the turning of undead creatures.~ [TTBRAN06]
@39300 = ~Paladins also have the ability to Turn Undead. Activating this icon will cause many undead creatures to flee or even be destroyed. ~
@39301 = ~When in this mode, the character can move wherever they wish. Any other action, such as attacking or casting a spell, will deactivate the ability. ~
@39302 = ~I am now going to teleport in a skeleton. Try to destroy it using my Turn Undead ability. ~
@39303 = ~You haven't destroyed the skeleton yet; what's wrong? My Turn Undead button is the skull on the bottom of your screen (if you have me selected).~ [TTBRAN07]
@39304 = ~Good job on destroying the skeleton. Now I'm going to introduce you to a surprise visitor. It's your childhood friend, Imoen!~ [TTBELT17]
@39305 = ~Heya! How are things going? You know, ever since you fought that Sarevok, you're all that the monks back at the keep can talk about.~ [TTIMOE90]
@39306 = ~She and I will be waiting on the next floor, so hurry on up there.~
@39307 = ~Anyway, I'm supposed to teach you about how to use Thief skills, but only after I join your party.~
@39308 = ~So anyway, I'll start with the Pick Pocket ability.~ [TTIMOE91]
@39309 = ~To use this ability, you must press the Thieving button on the bottom of the screen. This button obviously won't be there if a Thief is not selected first. The Thieving button is represented by an eye mask icon, which Thieves are occasionally known to wear.~
@39310 = ~Once you've selected the Thieving button, LEFT-CLICK on the person whose pocket you want to pick.~
@39311 = ~To give this a try, attempt to pickpocket a gem from Belt's pocket.~
@39312 = ~You haven't got the gem yet. What's taking you so long? To use this ability, you must press the Thieving button on the bottom of the screen. Once you've selected the Thieving button, LEFT-CLICK on the person you want to pickpocket. Remember: The Thieving button is represented by an eye-mask icon. Steal the gem from Belt!~ [TTIMOE92]
@39313 = ~Very good! Now I'm going to teach you how to detect and disarm traps.~ [TTIMOE93]
@39314 = ~To detect a trap, you must press the Find Traps button on the bottom of your screen. While it's active, any traps in the area that you detect will be highlighted in red. The Find Traps button is represented by an icon of four triangles.~
@39315 = ~Ervo~
@39316 = ~Ervo~
@39317 = ~When in this mode, the character can move wherever they wish. Any other action, such as attacking or casting a spell, will deactivate the ability. ~
@39318 = ~To disarm a trap, you must press the Thieving button. You must then LEFT-CLICK on the red highlighted trap. Watch out! If you fail in disarming the trap, the trap might be sprung.~
@39319 = ~There is a harmless trap on the west side of this room. I want you to detect and disarm it using my skills. Remember, press the Find Traps button to begin searching for traps. This button is represented by an icon of four triangles. It may take several moments for me to find the trap after I begin searching.~
@39320 = ~What's taking you so long to disarm the trap? Hurry up! Remember, to disarm a trap, you must press the Thieving button. You must then LEFT-CLICK on the red highlighted trap. The Thieving button is represented by an eye-mask icon.~ [TTIMOE94]
@39321 = ~Good job! You should also know that when you're in Detect Traps mode, you'll also be able to detect secret doors AND illusions.~ [TTIMOE95]
@39322 = ~The next ability you need to learn is the ability to Open Locks. To pick a lock, you must select the Thieving button and then LEFT-CLICK on whatever locked container you want to open. Once again, the Thieving button is represented by an eye-mask icon.~
@39323 = ~There is a locked chest on the west side of this floor. Use my abilities to pick the lock of the chest and steal the gem inside.~
@39324 = ~What's taking you so long? To pick a lock, you must select the Thieving button and then LEFT-CLICK on whatever locked container you want to open. Once again, the Thieving button is represented by an eye-mask icon.~ [TTIMOE96]
@39325 = ~Good job! The next ability I'm going to teach you is one of the most important a Thief can do: the ability to be stealthy.~ [TTIMOE97]
@39326 = ~Stoneskin~
@39327 = ~You will notice that at the bottom of the screen is a Stealth button. Simply LEFT-CLICK the button and your character will attempt to "hide in shadows." The Stealth button is represented by a face half in shadows.~
@39328 = ~When in this mode, the character can move wherever they wish. Any other action, such as attacking or casting a spell, will deactivate the ability. ~
@39329 = ~I now want you to try and put me into Stealth mode.~
@39330 = ~All right! Now that we've finished experimenting with Stealth, let's go to the last Thief ability: the Set Traps skill.~ [TTIMOE98]
@39331 = ~To set a trap, you must first access your special abilities. This is done by LEFT-CLICKING the Special Abilities button on the bottom right of your screen. This button has a four-cornered star icon.~
@39332 = ~When you press the Special Abilities button, it should bring up all of your special skills. One of those skills will be marked "Set Snares." Simply press the button and then LEFT-CLICK on the point where you want to set the trap.~
@39333 = ~Try setting a few traps. Belt will start you on the next part of your lesson in a few moments.~
@39334 = ~You've been doing very well. Now I'm going to introduce you to two more party members: Minsc and Jaheira. ~ [TTBELT18]
@39335 = ~They'll be teaching you a few more things, and then it will be time for your last test.~
@39336 = ~Hello there. I hope you've understood your lessons so far; they'll be of utmost importance when you get into the real world.~ [JAHEIRG2]
@39337 = ~Minsc and I are going to join your party and tell you about your remaining skills.~
@39338 = ~Minsc and Boo! You FORGOT Boo!~ [TTMINS91]
@39339 = ~Umm... yes, Minsc, I forgot Boo. Okay then, Minsc, BOO, and I are going to join your party and tell you about your remaining skills.~
@39340 = ~Boo has many pointers on how to adventure. He is a very wise hamster.~
@39341 = ~You will notice that there is a Special Abilities button on the bottom right of your screen. If you press this, the selected character's special skills will come up.~ [JAHEIRG3]
@39342 = ~Different classes have different skills. Druids have the ability to Shapechange, Rangers have the ability to Charm Animals, and Paladins have the ability to Lay on Hands and Cure Disease.~
@39343 = ~The Bard also has an extra ability, but you do not have to access the special abilities to use it. ~
@39344 = ~When you have your Bard character selected, a harp icon will appear in the middle bottom of your screen. Pressing the button activates the Bard Song.~
@39345 = ~Bards can inspire their comrades in combat by use of the Bard Song. They are able to move when singing, but any other action will end the song.~
@39346 = ~Why don't you take a few moments to experiment with our abilities?~
@39347 = ~You've done a fine job so far, but there is still more to come. You'll notice that when you have a group of characters selected, there is a list of Party Formation buttons on the bottom of the screen.~ [TTBELT19]
@39348 = ~Just select one of the formations, and whenever you walk your party around as a group, they will walk in that formation.~
@39349 = ~You can access even more formation types by RIGHT-CLICKING on one of the Formation buttons.~
@39350 = ~I'm going to give you a little time to experiment with the formation types. Then we'll go to your final test.~
@39351 = ~All right then. Enough lessons—time for the test.~ [TTBELT20]
@39352 = ~I'm going to allow you entry to the basement now. This is where your final test is to take place.~ [TTBELT21]
@39353 = ~This man is a great evil if he does such things! The shining blades of goodness must be raised against him! Justice demands a painful, pointy thrashing!~
@39354 = ~I've... heard rumors about the owner of this place before, but I never thought that the truth went to this extent. This place... is repulsive. We must do something!~
@39355 = ~Hmph. He could nae be that great a warrior if he were captured, I think.~
@39356 = ~Aye now, there it is. There be no profit in this. Let us leave the barbarian be, <GABBER>...~
@39357 = ~Bah! Must we listen to such sniveling?! It sickens the stomach!~
@39358 = ~Aye... and naturally, he shall not put the profits of the inn into depraved entertainments similar to the current ones. Aye, surely we can believe a filthy barbarian.~
@39359 = ~Such suspicion is misplaced, good knight. Were you on the other side of these bars, I am sure you would feel similarly.~
@39360 = ~Such a comment is unworthy of you, Anomen. We've more reason to trust this man than to trust you, it seems.~
@39361 = ~Profit does not lie in coin alone, my brawny dwarf. Let us consider the man's offer, for there may be much that we could potentially gain.~

Fireball
(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

A Fireball is an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it—1d6 points of damage for each level of experience of the caster (up to a maximum of 10d6). The wizard points <PRO_HISHER> finger and speaks the range (distance and height) at which the Fireball is to burst. A streak flashes from the pointing digit and, unless it impacts upon a material body or solid barrier prior to attaining the prescribed range, blossoms into the fireball (an early impact results in an early detonation). Creatures failing their Saving Throws each suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful Saving Throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half.~

Invisibility
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell causes the creature touched to vanish from sight and be undetectable by normal vision or even infravision. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable. Even allies cannot see the invisible creature or its gear, unless these allies can normally see invisible things or employ magic to do so. Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. The spell remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled, until the recipient attacks any creature, or until 24 hours have passed. The caster cannot perform any actions that manipulate the environment around <PRO_HIMHER>, such as opening doors, disarming a trap, or opening a chest. The caster can, however, cast defensive spells on <PRO_HIMHER>self and fellow party members. And if <PRO_HESHE> attacks, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible, although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first.~

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of one foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has two major effects: First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Second, summoned demons cannot target the protected creature.~

Level: 5
Sphere: Divination
Range: 0
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 70-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, an area roughly 70 ft. in radius around the caster will be affected. Instantly and once each round for 1 turn after this spell is cast, all hostile Illusion/Phantasm spells in the area of effect will be dispelled. The spells that are affected by this are Reflected Image, Invisibility, Mirror Image, Non-Detection, Improved Invisibility, Shadow Door, Mislead, Project Image, and Simulacrum. The area of effect is roughly a 70-ft. radius around the caster. The target's Magic Resistance, if any, does not come into effect with this spell. This spell only affects enemies; thus, it is unable to dispel the invisibility from a party member.~

Spell Turning
(Abjuration)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This powerful abjuration spell causes the spells cast against the wizard to rebound upon the original caster. This affects a total of 12 spell levels—including spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities—but excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard, as well as area effects that are stationary, such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud.

As long as there are levels remaining, the spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be reflected while canceling the Spell Turning.

This spell will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but it will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

Stinking Cloud
(Evocation)

Level: 2
Range: 90 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

When casting a Stinking Cloud spell, the wizard creates a billowing mass of nauseous vapors up to 90 ft. away from <PRO_HISHER> position. Any creature caught within the cloud must roll a successful Save vs. Poison at +2 or be sent reeling and fall down for 1d2 rounds. Those who make successful Saving Throws can leave the cloud without suffering any ill effects, although those remaining in the cloud must continue to save each round. Dispel Magic will remove the nausea on a particular character, but if they remain in the cloud, then they are still subject to its effects.~

(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: 120 ft.+ 30 ft./level
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, the wizard releases a powerful stroke of electrical energy that inflicts 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster (maximum damage of 10d6) to each creature within its area of effect. A successful Save vs. Spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). The bolt begins at a range and height decided by the caster and streaks outward in a direct line from the casting wizard (e.g. if a 40-ft. bolt was started at 180 ft. from the wizard, the far end of bolt would reach 220 ft. (180+40)). If the Lightning Bolt intersects with a wall, it will bounce until it reaches its full length.~

Burning Hands
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: 1/2

When the wizard casts this spell, a jet of searing flame shoots from <PRO_HISHER> fingertips. The wizard's hands must be held so as to send forth a fanlike sheet of flames: <PRO_HISHER> thumbs must touch each other and the fingers must be spread. The burning hands send out flame jets of 5 ft. length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the wizard. Any creature in the area of the flames suffers 1d3 points of damage, +2 points for each level of the caster, to a maximum of 1d3+20 points of fire damage. Those successfully saving vs. Spell receive half damage.~

The magic in the hammer draws it back to the hand of its wielder. If it hits an opponent, it does double the normal damage that a hammer would normally do. Against giants and ogres, the hammer does an additional +8 damage due to the special hatred that dwarves hold against these races.

His intention was to gift them to his son, who was then a high officer in the dwarven armies, fighting the giant and ogre tribes of the area. Unfortunately, Silverblade's son died just after the completion of the three items and before they could be gifted to him. In grief, Silverblade himself donned the girdle and the gauntlets. Taking up the Hammer of Thunderbolts, he went to battle against the giant folk. He died valiantly.

Alone, the Hammer of Thunderbolts is a powerful magical weapon, but when merged with the gauntlets of ogre power and the girdle of frost giant strength, the hammer is transformed. This transformation requires magical assistance. The Hammer of Thunderbolts is then capable of doing an additional +8 damage as well as instantly killing any giant or ogre that it strikes.

Beroalf was a barbarian who traveled from the cold north in search of adventure. He sought treasures and glory, but soon all he wanted were companions to share in the excitement of battle, much like those he had left behind in his faraway village. Unfortunately, his coarse remarks and rudimentary hygiene repelled most travelers he met, until he expressed his thoughts to a sympathetic mage. The mage, for a price, constructed Ras, the dancing blade. Though not quite what Beroalf had in mind, he was thrilled nonetheless and wielded the sword for many years. How they were ultimately separated is not known.

Dungeon-delving Lehorgan was lucky indeed to discover this Halruaan blade in the ruins of the ancient sorcerer Kullon's haunt, for it would save his life that very day. The ghost of Kullon himself attacked the intruder, but the flames that followed only singed, absorbed into the glowing Bloodbrand. Concealing himself, Lehorgan watched in amazement as the ancient sorcerer tried to divine his location, and again the sword protected him. Surviving this brush with death, the young man used this second chance and the gold from selling the blade to, as he put it, "get the hell out of adventuring."

@39909 = ~(Uhhh...) Wh... what's going on? What's happening here?~
@39910 = ~Here is the problem as I see it. My father... had regular dealings with the Roenalls, though at times I am sure he viewed them with as much distaste as I do.~
@39911 = ~All others are treated as dirt. My father had dealings with them, but he was not like them. They tolerated him because of his wealth and willingness to conform.~
@39912 = ~You were charmed, I believe, by the trolls...~
@39913 = ~Yes... yes, I remember now. It was... it was horrible! Oh, thank you so much for freeing me from that enchantment!~
@39914 = ~You... you must find the leader of the trolls... TorGal, I believe his name is. You must find him and kill him! If he falls, the rest of his minions will flee.~
@39915 = ~I am afraid that I do not know where he is, though... or where Lord de'Arnise is, exactly. I... I wish I did. But I think I do know something that might help you...~
@39916 = ~My father earned his living while others squandered. The Roenalls sought to increase their links to him through marriage. They are powerful, and he reluctantly agreed.~
@39917 = ~Lord de'Arnise was looking for a flail that belongs to him... it was disassembled long ago and the heads spread throughout the keep. I was helping him search when we were captured.~
@39918 = ~He said it had powers of flame and acid and the like... things that would have aided us greatly against the trolls had we found them in time. I... have the first of the heads with me, still... you may have it.~
@39919 = ~I cannot thank you enough for releasing me. I... I would help you, more, but I simply cannot face them again. I... I wish you well...~
@39920 = ~I propose a partnership, in secret of course, wherein you assume title to this place. You will become the figurehead of the keep, and I will be a ward of sorts.~
@39921 = ~The troll leader is dead? That is... that is good. I must find Captain Arat... and see if anyone else is alive here. P-please... excuse me...~
@39922 = ~You have known us for so short a time, yet you have bought our freedom with blood. My child, my friend, it is a debt I can never repay...~
@39923 = ~Accept? No, they could not do much. It is not uncommon for a fighting <PRO_MANWOMAN> to take possession of a keep once the lord of the manor is... is dead.~
@39924 = ~Ring of Vampiric Regeneration~
@39925 = ~Naught but your strength of... character. It's not uncommon to take over a keep once the lord is... is dead. The heirs must merely declare it so.~
@39926 = ~This will benefit us both! You gain status while my home is maintained as befits my father. It is not uncommon to take over a keep when the lord is... is dead.~
@39927 = ~We can leave, though you are welcome to inspect or organize as you see fit. The servants will return this place to order. Again, I thank you.~
@39928 = ~If my rights to control of my father's dealings are void, then why are the conditions that built those dealings not? Do you plan to release control of the keep to me?~
@39929 = ~I take it that my job here is done? Am I free to leave now?~
@39930 = ~I cannot ease your pain. I have done what I could, but there is little else for me to do here.~
@39931 = ~I feel as though my work is not done. I could not save your father, and I am sorry.~
@39932 = ~Sorry that I can't stick around to figure it out. You did say something about a reward?~
@39933 = ~I have done what I can. Might I expect a reward? I do not mean to appear crass.~
@39934 = ~Oh, of course. You have done just as asked, and I wish you well. I will see what there is to pay you and then I will... I will... oh no. Might I ask you to...~
@39935 = ~No, no it is foolish to think such things. I will pay you and return to the life that I must.~
@39936 = ~Speak, Nalia. I will lose no sleep wondering what you might have said.~
@39937 = ~What is it? There is no harm in asking.~
@39938 = ~It is the matter of what is to become of me. My... my father, lord of this place, is dead. In the circles of nobility, the title of lord falls to the male heir.~
@39939 = ~So you obviously want me to assume the role. A marriage of convenience perhaps? ~
@39940 = ~I would assume the role if I could, but obviously I cannot help you in this matter.~
@39941 = ~And what is it that you wish of me?~
@39942 = ~I know little of such things. Speak your mind and speak it plain.~
@39943 = ~What? Oh no, no, no, nothing like that. Goodness no. Perish the thought. Really. That would cause no end of scandal.~
@39944 = ~I intend to leave. There is little else for me here. I am... betrothed to a brat of a man, who will certainly try to usurp control of this place from me.~
@39945 = ~Perhaps it's best just to leave. My father always said you could tell a person by their actions, not their possessions. Quaint, but it will help me sleep at night.~
@39946 = ~You do not wish to fight for your home? Is there nothing I can do?~
@39947 = ~You are welcome to accompany me if you wish. They will not trouble you on the road.~
@39948 = ~I have no need of your company anymore. You will have to do what you can here.~
@39949 = ~Hostility would only bring soldiers. They are not criminals, just repugnant. If you were more a fighting sort, you might serve as figurehead, but you are not.~
@39950 = ~No, I should leave. Could I seek sanctuary in your adventuring company? I yearn to go out among the needy and help them. Life was so sheltered here.~
@39951 = ~You can seek sanctuary with me, if you like. The road is a hard life though.~
@39952 = ~I only wanted to have you in the group until your keep was freed. You should leave now.~
@39953 = ~Good, then. I will go with you. It will be sad to see this place go to bad use, but I've no choice. I will not serve the Roenall family in their snobbish deals.~
@39954 = ~There is little hope for my future. I will be pampered until I am what I hated. Go then, and live your life of adventure. I will waste away here.~
@39955 = ~A gift to Derek Poodon, apprentice warrior, this ring was his salvation when he stumbled upon two Red Wizards traveling through the Cloakwood Forest. Enraged at being disturbed, the mages unleashed a score of Magic Missiles at the seemingly helpless Derek, but to their brief surprise, the assault reflected back and killed them both. Thereafter, without having lifted his blade, Derek was rather sheepishly known as Derek the Red Slayer.

A Sunfire is like a Fireball—an explosive burst of flame, which detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the caster: 1d6 points of damage per level of the caster, up to a maximum of 15d6.

The suitors gathered from all across Kara-Tur to test their skill, and although she fought with no weapons but her open hands, she bested every single one of them. Disappointed, all suitors left but one—a young man with kind eyes and a pair of gilded bracers, which he presented to her as a gift. "No one can hope to tame your passions," he said, "and those who would try will never understand your heart. May these trinkets serve as a reminder that your temper is your own and not to be controlled." Lin Mei did not marry that man, but she left home with him that day to seek adventure, and together they spent the rest of their lives in closer partnership than any husband and wife. Eventually the pair retired, and Lin Mei quietly disappeared from the annals of history. All that remains of her story are the bracers she wore, still burning with the fire of her untamed passion.

Yet when he discovered the merchant's gift, so the story goes, Sarutobi refused to wear the bracers, saying "I will crush this giant's skull with my bare hands, and I need no magic to help me do it!" Sarutobi carried the day, and the merchant locked the bracers away in his safe. When Sarutobi disappeared one day through a planar door, the merchant took the opportunity to give the bracers to Sarutobi's son, as small compensation for the loss of his father. The boy took the bracers and devoted his life to searching for his father. He never found him.

In a cordial, if somewhat bittersweet, conversation, she informed you that your calming presence was required in the North among the frontier towns there. Almost as an afterthought, she mentioned her concerns over portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North; your mentor chose you to represent the order and to help soothe the brewing tensions in the region.

Though the prospect of leaving the monastery that was your home was daunting, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to prove yourself, to do some good rather than remaining cloistered behind the walls of the monastery among the same twelve monks for the next seventy years. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, equipped only with the wisdom of your training and your mentor's words.~

Though the prospect of leaving the monastery that was your home was daunting, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to prove yourself, to do some good rather than remaining cloistered behind the walls of the monastery praying to an altar for the next seventy years.

@40275 = ~Less than a fortnight after your official initiation into the order of the Dark Moon, your abbess interrupted your contemplations for a secret meeting. In a cordial, if unusually cold, conversation, she informed you that Shar's influence was required in the North among the frontier towns there, and that you would be representing the order. Almost as an afterthought, she mentioned her particular interest in specific portents and omens concerning the events transpiring in the North.

Though such exploratory missions are usually tasked to the initiates seeking approval of their betters rather than full members of the order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to more deeply explore and understand the cold mysteries of the Lady of Shadow, to perform her dark rituals at the Spine of the World rather than cloistered behind the walls of the monastery doing laborious subterfuge for the next seventy years. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, equipped only with the wisdom of your training and the comfort of your shadow.~
@40276 = ~Although the life of a warrior holds a deeply rooted place in your heart, the huge cities and bustling crowds of southern Faerûn have always made you restless. You have tired of the laws and ordinances dictating how a warrior is supposed to conduct themselves among "civilized" folk, and more than one perfectly good brawl has been ruined by the arrival of the city guards. Perhaps it was for this reason you chose to head to the North, where the untamed wilderness would be a better place to seek one's fortune, and the lands themselves had yet to be broken by the passage of man and the slow creep of civilization. Perhaps in the shadow of the Spine of the World, you can find the adventure and glory you seek, and a chance to carve a name for yourself in the snow-covered lands.~
@40277 = ~Upholding all that is right and good is a crusade that knows no boundaries, and it chafes at the spirits of those who understand the only real morality is dictated by those with the strength and will to rule. In the cities and towns of Faerûn you can feel false morality creeping into the hearts and minds of the sheep that worship at temples rather than taking what is rightfully theirs. You have chosen a different path, a better one: your patron is darkness, your morality the end of your blade, your cause the despoiling of the world.

In the dark, cold parts of the world are hidden vaults containing avenues to power that even you have not yet conceived; and in the untamed wilderness of the North, unguarded by the passage of man, you have rightly identified an opportunity to make early claim to whatever power awaits you.~
@40278 = ~Although the life of a warrior has always held your heart, the mines of your dwarven home have chafed at your spirit. You have tired of constantly beating back the same hordes of drow and goblins, and these days it sometimes seemed that you couldn't raise your shield without some young upstart crashing into you from behind. Perhaps it was for this reason you chose to head to the North, where stories of old warriors and heroes call to mind a simpler time of honor and glory. Perhaps in the shadow of the Spine of the World, you can find some measure of the valor that is missing from your home.~
@40279 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation ceremony into the Temple of Lathander, you were summoned before the Dawnmaster of your order. In warm words fitting for a follower of the Morninglord, she gave you your first assignment as a member of the clergy: to travel to the frontier towns of the North and bring the light of the Morninglord to the people that make the harsh environments their home. Almost as an afterthought, she spoke to you of portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to soothe potential troubles in the region.

Though these missions to the untamed wilderness are often considered an unwanted chore by the less optimistic members of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to bring hope and light to the people of the North, a chance to do some real good rather than settling into weekly services delivered for the temple's casual worshipers in the city. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, with only a staff in hand and the light of the Morninglord in your heart.~
@40280 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation into the Temple of Helm, you were summoned before the High Watcher of your order. In a cordial, if somewhat cold meeting, you were assigned your first duty as a full member of the temple: to make a pilgrimage to the North and see if you could spread the faith to the frontier towns. Almost as an afterthought, he informed you of his "concerns" over portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North, and it was the belief of the temple that a representative of their interests there might serve to maintain peace in the region.

Though these pilgrimages are often considered an unwanted duty by the more politically minded clergymen of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to bring order to the people of the North, a chance to do some good rather than falling into a routine and simply presiding over the usual services within the temple. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, with only a staff in hand and the doctrines of your faith firmly etched in your mind.~
@40281 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation ceremony into the Temple of Talos, you were summoned before the Stormherald of your temple. In a cordial, if somewhat cold meeting, you were assigned your first duty as a Talon: to make a pilgrimage to the North and see if you could bring the teachings of Talos to the frontier towns. Almost as an afterthought, he mentioned portents and omens concerning events transpiring in the North that might be of interest to the Storm Lord; it was the belief of the temple that a representative of Talos might serve to exploit the potential troubles in the region.

Though these pilgrimages are often considered an unwanted duty by the more politically minded clergymen of your order, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed to be a chance to do the Storm Lord's will in a practical way, an opportunity to escape the routine of leading prayers and extorting noblemen in the city. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday you set out on your journey, armed only with a staff in your hand and a brewing storm in your heart.~
@40282 = ~It's a well-known saying that a life lived without purpose is not worth living. Many people believe this, but they never seem to understand that sometimes a client may decide he doesn't agree with the purpose they've chosen for themselves. Sometimes a client pays good money to have them dealt with, and when they do, you always find your pockets lined with gold. Almost always, that is. Someone saw you this time, and they weren't happy about your choice of targets. Maybe they didn't see you clearly enough to identify you to the authorities, but sooner or later someone will identify the poison's ingredients and trace them back to their source. The city guards don't take kindly to those who make their living on the murder of high-profile nobility.

So, with a heavy heart, you have left the shadows and rooftops of your home, and decided to take an extended vacation to the North. Perhaps in a few years they'll forget about the man you killed and it will be safe for you to return to your client for your payment, but until then, you'd much rather see what new contracts the frontier towns have to offer. After all, a life lived without purpose is not worth living.~
@40283 = ~It's a well-known saying that the best-laid plans often go awry. Most people agree with this, but they don't realize just how awry even the most elaborate plan can go. You don't know who told the guards that you were the one who kidnapped that well-respected nobleman, but the omission of your partner's name from the wanted posters suggests foul play. The life of a bounty hunter has never been glamorous, and it carries with it some obvious risks, but a life in prison or a trip to the noose has never been high on your list of acceptable outcomes.

So, with a heavy heart, you have left the gold-paved streets of your home, and have chosen to make a pilgrimage to the North. Perhaps in a few years the guards will have forgotten about you and it will be safe to return, but until then it's best to lay low, bide your time, and—in the quiet corners of your mind—plan for your revenge.~
@40284 = ~Books and years of study are the purview of mages, but for those born with the talent a decade of schooling seems a waste of tuition. You learned your magic through trial and error and more than a few explosive catastrophes, but you have just as much power at your disposal as any scholar hiding behind a tome. Even so, the odd mishap has made city living a dangerous endeavor; at the urging of your friends, family, and the local guards, you have "decided" to take an extended vacation to the safely unsettled wilderness of the North. Perhaps with a few years of dedicated practice under your belt it will be "safe" for you to return home. And in the mean-time, you never know what new tricks you might learn without the crowds and suspicions of the city keeping your power in check.~
@40285 = ~Books and years of study are the purview of mages whose power is locked behind walls of memory and formulas. For those with the blood of a dragon in their veins, however, all that schooling seems a profound waste of tuition. You learned your magic by exploring the fiery power of your draconic ancestry, and although you don't know as many spells as a scholar hiding behind a tome, your power is limited only by the strength of your bloodline.

Unfortunately, a duel with an adept from the local college has earned you a violent reputation; at the urging of the local guards and a few friends, you have "decided" to leave the bustling city for a trip to the North. Perhaps they think a few years in the cold will tame your burning spirit, but on the frontier you spot the true opportunity: to grow in power and discover what it truly means to be a descendant of dragons.~
@40286 = ~There's a popular saying that he who lives by the sword, dies by the sword. It's a philosophy that has guided your specialized training; the knowledge of your own mortality has gotten you out of more than one conflict unscathed. In the bustling cities to the south, however, warriors and mercenaries embrace violence and war as though they were invincible, leaping into battles that mean nothing and often leaving this plane with no honor or glory to speak of. Perhaps it is for this reason you decided to make the hard journey to the North, where the untamed wilderness of the frontier towns offers a rare opportunity for a warrior to follow the philosophy of their choice. Whether it is glory that awaits you or a frozen grave makes no difference; whatever fate has in store, it will have been a fate guided by your own hands.~

A creature acting as a familiar can benefit its master, conveying its sensory powers to <PRO_HIMHER>, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well.

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the Beast Master confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The Beast Master has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The Beast Master receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the Beast Master must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the Beast Master loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also, when a familiar dies, the Beast Master loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A Beast Master has 10 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The fairy dragon summoned has 12 Hit Points, so the Beast Master gets a bonus of 6 Hit Points. The Beast Master now has 16 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the Beast Master loses those 6 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 10), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 12 damage.

Here is a list of the familiars that the Beast Master receives according to alignment:

LAWFUL GOOD, NEUTRAL GOOD: Pseudo Dragon
– Hit Points: 12
– Armor Class: 0
– Magic Resistance: 35%

Of course, the whispers are all spoken in the language of goblins, making them more or less useless to the humanoid races; even so, the stone bestows greater knowledge on any who possess it.

@40494 = ~That's none of your business.~
@40495 = ~Does it really matter?~
@40496 = ~I guess it doesn't really matter. I was merely curious.~
@40497 = ~Yes, I think this could be very useful to me. And, I suspect, probably just deadweight for adventurers.~
@40498 = ~For the toolbox, I'm willing to part with some of my best potions. I think those may be more useful in your travels than some musty old toolbox.~
@40499 = ~Sorry, Oswald, but I'd really rather have some gold.~
@40500 = ~I'm interested... but what kind of potions?~
@40501 = ~That sounds fair. You've got yourself a deal, Oswald.~
@40502 = ~Ha! Think a bit of coin might be more useful! Fair enough, but I don't think I have as much coin to offer as potions. How does 150 gold sound?~
@40503 = ~What potions, then, could you offer?~
@40504 = ~Sorry Oswald, I'm not interested.~
@40505 = ~Agreed.~
@40506 = ~How about two potions of healing, a potion of invisibility, and a potion of heroism?~
@40507 = ~Excellent, excellent. Now is there anything else I can help you with? Something from my stock, perhaps?~

@40509 = ~Is there anything else I can help you with? Something from my stock, perhaps?~
@40510 = ~Are you still interested in these tools?~

@40512 = ~On second thought, I'm still not ready to sell these.~
@40513 = ~Welcome back. I heard from Orrick that you bought the Girdle of Gond from him. I had my eye on that Girdle for some time but didn't act fast enough.~
@40514 = ~I have a proposal that may be beneficial to both of us, if you'll hear me out.~
@40515 = ~I wanted to examine the Girdle to see how it works—what enchantments have been used, how it's assembled—in the hopes that I may be able to make one myself.~
@40516 = ~If you would be willing to part with it for a day... let's call it a loan... I would be most grateful.~
@40517 = ~Sure Oswald, if it'll help your studies.~
@40518 = ~I know too many gnomes. You're not going to take it apart, are you?~

@40524 = ~If that's all you have, just take the belt. I don't need the gold.~
@40525 = ~Yeah, 50 gold is fine.~
@40526 = ~Thank you! A day should be enough to sort out your little secrets...~
@40527 = ~Did you still want to borrow the Girdle of Gond?~
@40528 = ~Thank you for loaning me your Girdle of Gond. I've learned a great deal more than I had thought I would.~
@40529 = ~So much, in fact, that I think I can make it work even better.~
@40530 = ~With a few more enchantments, I think I can incorporate some of the tools from that dusty old toolbox you sold to me.~

@40535 = ~No, I just want my Girdle back.~
@40536 = ~Well, then here's your Girdle back. If you change your mind, I'd love to do some tinkering.~

@40549 = ~It appears to be spell incantations. I think this shield may be able to cast spells, if we can decrypt this text.~
@40550 = ~I'd be willing to do so, for a price. As I mentioned before, I'm interested in buying armor to barter with the spirits of the island.~
@40551 = ~They seem to prefer old, rusted shells of armor. Bring me three of them and I'll translate your text.~
@40552 = ~Here you are.~
@40553 = ~I'll be back with some armor.~
@40554 = ~Perfect, just what I'm looking for. The translation shouldn't take more than a few hours to complete.~
@40555 = ~Is there anything else you need?~
@40556 = ~We have brought three suits of armor. Can you translate the text on Mystery of the Dead now?~
@40557 = ~I have translated as much text as possible. Some of it is simply beyond me, but I have deciphered two incantations.~
@40558 = ~One is for repelling undead, and the other appears to be a healing spell.~
@40559 = ~Do you know anything about the Young Rage axe?~
@40560 = ~Can't say I've heard o' it, laddie. Let me hold it for a moment.~
@40561 = ~Aye, I can feel the rage of my kin again't the one who forced them to make it.~
@40562 = ~'Tis a terrible thing, but ye need more 'en me. Ye need the help of a necromancer.~
@40563 = ~Edion, over on the barbarians' burial isle, is a necromancer.~
@40564 = ~We have a necromancer in our party.~
@40565 = ~If I meet one, I'll come back.~
@40566 = ~Anything else ye be wantin'?~
@40567 = ~Do ye now? Well, I can do my part. Once we're done here, take the axe to 'im.~
@40568 = ~He'll need to put their spirits to rest.~
@40569 = ~Lend me your necromancer and let's get started.~
@40570 = ~There we go. I've done me part, now ye need to take this to Edion.~
@40571 = ~This scroll explains what he has to do.~
@40572 = ~What were you saying about the Young Rage axe again?~
@40573 = ~What do I need to do with Young Rage again?~
@40574 = ~Take that note to your necromancer friend over on the Burial Isle so he can put the spirits in the axe to rest.~
@40575 = ~I need you to banish the spirits of Young Rage.~
@40576 = ~You need me to—what?~
@40577 = ~A blind dwarven smith said we can banish the spirits plaguing this axe with the aid of a necromancer. He sent instructions.~
@40578 = ~Let me see that.~
@40579 = ~Yes, this seems straightforward enough. I'll need 300 gold for my services.~
@40580 = ~Perhaps we'll do this later.~
@40581 = ~It's a simple exorcism, for a cost of 300 gold.~
@40582 = ~What's needed for the Young Rage axe again?~
@40583 = ~Aye, thanks for yer help with the spirits. The rage trapped in the axe has been put to rest.~
@40584 = ~Welcome back. I have your cloak ready, though I had forgotten how much I hate working with fur. I hope you enjoy it, for I will not be making another.~
@40585 = ~From the reek, you can probably tell your yeti hide armor is ready. It will take many months for the smell to leave, and I will not be working with any more yeti pelts.~
@40586 = ~Orrick may be able to make something out of those pelts, too.~
@40587 = ~Mirek mentioned you may be able to do something with these winter wolf pelts.~
@40588 = ~Mirek mentioned you may be able to do something with these yeti pelts.~
@40589 = ~How about winter wolf pelts?~
@40590 = ~What about yeti pelts?~
@40591 = ~The pelts can be sewn together into a cloak. With a few cantrips, we can preserve some of the winter wolf's natural protections in the cloak.~
@40592 = ~But it takes a lot of raw material and work. I'd need at least five pelts and 3500 gold.~
@40593 = ~That sounds great. Let's do it.~
@40594 = ~No, I don't think I'm interested.~
@40595 = ~Yeti pelts are not the best of materials to work with, but Conlan and myself may be able to make some hide armor out of them.~
@40596 = ~It's a bit tougher and stiffer than leather. I'll be able to lay some enchantments into the materials as they cure.~
@40597 = ~It'll take a lot of material, though, and some pricey spell components. We'll probably need 10 pelts and, oh, 2500 gold.~
@40598 = ~Excellent. I shall send these to the seamstress straightaway. Come back in a day or so and I'll have your cloak ready.~
@40599 = ~Very well. I'll go and talk with Conlan about making some armor and enchanting it. Return in three days or so.~
@40600 = ~Can I help you with anything else?~
@40601 = ~Can you do anything with these remorhaz shells?~
@40602 = ~Sure. I know some craftsmen who can make helmets out of them. It'll cost 8000 gold.~
@40603 = ~I need some time to gather that much gold.~
@40604 = ~Thanks for the information.~
@40605 = ~Come back in three days and I'll have your helmet ready.~
@40606 = ~Anything else I can do for you?~
@40607 = ~Is my helmet ready yet, Dirty Llew?~
@40608 = ~Here you are.~
@40609 = ~Sure. I know some craftsmen who can make helmets out of them. It'll cost 7000 gold.~
@40610 = ~For you, my lovely, I know some craftsmen who can make helmets out of them. It'll cost 5000 gold.~
@40611 = ~Gond, god of invention and artifice, is a deity rarely worshipped by traditional adventurers. Some thieves, however, revere Gond for his role in the development of locks, traps, and other complex machines. One such thief was the burglar Jurmar the Calm, who began his career as a locksmith. Known for his cool demeanor and steady hand, Jurmar paid priests of Gond to fashion this tool belt for him. Whenever Jurmar was stuck in a situation where he didn't have the right tool for a job, one of the small pouches on the belt would supply him with what he needed.

Oswald has managed to add even more tools for the belt, further enhancing its usefulness.

Hide armor is far too bulky, inflexible and heavy to be used much in advanced human cultures. However, among the barbaric humanoid masses throughout the dark forests and misty jungles of the world, hide armor is common. Even though it does offer more protection than leather armor, one must get by the offensive odor and shoddy appearance in order to wear it effectively. Even though Thieves can wear this armor, it has a negative effect on their abilities.

Legedain was growing old and becoming tired of his frail body. To remedy the situation, he cast Magic Jar and forced Ilfain's spirit into a host gem. Legedain then transferred his soul to the young elf's body and left the gem on a shelf nearby. One hundred years later, Legedain decided to do something with it. He created a sword for his arrogant bodyguard, Gundak, and transferred Ilfain's spirit from the host gem into the sword. Ilfain, always highly critical in life, started telepathically criticizing Gundak in combat. Gundak became annoyed with the sword after two weeks, and he threw it into the street. A series of warriors picked it up and discarded it after short periods of ownership. Over time, the weapon has simply come to be known by its current name.

Kieran Nye has applied a permanent Hope spell to the sword. While the sword is still very gloomy, it no longer criticizes its wielder and its thieving abilities can be used more often.

He traveled for forty years and is known for some of the most unique, haunting melodies in Faerûn.

Hegelfden grew up believing that he was special, important, and somehow better than those around him. By the age of seventeen, Hegelfden was an accomplished warrior. Huge, fast, and cunning, he was more than a match for his kinsmen. On a journey into the Spine of the World, Hegelfden captured two dwarves that he came across in a cave. He refused to let the two workers go until they created a magnificent axe for him. The two dwarves reluctantly agreed, creating a stout battle axe with a keen blade and a thick handle. When the dwarves asked to be released, Hegelfden denied their request. He wanted to keep them as servants. The dwarves then laid a curse upon Hegelfden. They told him that the fruit of his abuse would be the end of him. Hegelfden laughed at the dwarves' claim and continued on with his life. The next day, in a battle with a rival tribe, Hegelfden went berserk with blood lust, slaying every creature he came across. His kin, convinced that he had gone mad, cut him down where he stood. The axe was left on the field when the warriors brought Hegelfden's body back to the camp. When they arrived, the dwarves were nowhere to be found.

With Tiernon's guidance, the angry dwarven souls in the axe have been laid to rest.

We should find a boat and seek him there.~
@40681 = ~Priest of Tyr~
@40682 = ~PRIEST OF TYR: Tyr is the deity of law and justice and is primarily concerned with the punishment of wrongdoers and the general furthering of law and good in the world. The belief in justice through (benevolent) force, or at least armed vigilance, is the reason for Tyr's existence. Tyr holds great prominence in the pantheon due to his position as leader of the Triad, a trio of lawful good gods that are collectively devoted to the concepts of courage, justice, perseverance, relief of suffering, duty, obedience, honor, and to some extent, righteous martyrdom.

Advantages:

DIVINE FAVOR: This spell grants the caster a +1 bonus to hit and damage rolls every 3 levels of the caster. The spell lasts for 2 rounds.

(Necromancy)

Level: 3
Sphere: Necromantic, Protection
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By invoking this spell, the caster switches <PRO_HISHER> own life force with that of the recipient, exchanging all physical injuries. The spell will only function if the caster has more Hit Points than the target before the switch is attempted. This switch is permanent until the caster uses normal methods to heal the damage. The exchange can be done from a distance so long as the spell range is not exceeded. Only the Hit Points are exchanged; the caster cannot take on other conditions from the target such as disease, poison, intoxication, and similar afflictions. 

This spell cannot be cast by evil-aligned characters. It has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.~
@40773 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation into the temple of Tyr, you were summoned by the high priest of your order. In a ceremony observed by veterans of your faith, you were given your first assignment as a full member of the temple: to venture north to the Spine of the World, seek out whatever evil lurks there, and destroy it. Almost as an afterthought, he informed you about his "concerns" over portents and omens surrounding events transpiring in the North. If there is any truth to these visions, a member of the church of Tyr must be there to protect the mountains' residents from whatever is to come.

Despite the dangers known to be common on the slopes of the mountains, you found yourself eager to accept the task. It seemed the perfect chance to prove your devotion to the Maimed God, protecting the people of the North from whatever lies in wait—and it also offers an alternative to what would surely be a dull routine in the temple, blessing knights on their way to more glorious adventures. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and before the week was out, you embarked on your journey north, with only a staff and your virtue to protect you.~
@40774 = ~priest of Tempus~
@40775 = ~Priest of Tempus~
@40776 = ~PRIEST OF TEMPUS: Tempus, also known as the Lord of Battles or the Foehammer, is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus may be on an army's side one day and against them the next; such is the nature of war. Tempuran clergy can be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know whom the war god will favor.

Advantages:
- May cast Holy Power once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 5 levels thereafter.
- May cast Chaos of Battle once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 10 levels thereafter.

CHAOS OF BATTLE: Chaos of Battle applies bonuses to all allies and penalties to all enemies within a 30-ft. radius of the caster. The spell lasts 1 turn and will randomly affect the targets' Armor Class, Hit Points, THAC0, saves, or luck. The magnitude of the effect starts at 1 (5 for Hit Points) at level 1 and will improve by 1 (5 for Hit Points) every 6 levels of the caster.

Disadvantages:
– Alignment restricted to chaotic good, chaotic neutral, chaotic evil, or true neutral.~
@40777 = ~Less than a fortnight after your initiation into Tempus's church, you were summoned by the Swordmaster of your order. Speaking in words that promised glory to the faith, she gave you your first assignment as a full member of the temple: to travel boldly into the North and make contact with the temple in Easthaven. Almost as an afterthought, she told you to be vigilant in your journey, citing "concerns" over portents and omens surrounding events transpiring in the North. It is the belief of the temple that if there is glory to be had in these uncertain times, it should be had in service of the Lord of Battles.

Though there seems little glory in traversing the frozen slopes on the Spine of the World, you found yourself eager to accept the challenge. It seemed to be an opportunity to show the people of the North that bravery and valor can come from the cities to the South as well, and avoid the tedium of polishing armor for the temple's more decorated clergy. Without hesitation, you agreed to make the pilgrimage, and within a tenday, you embarked on your journey North, with only a staff in hand and the hymns of battle echoing loudly in your heart.~

@40781 = ~Greetings, Accalia. Rituals, you say? What kind of rituals are celebrated by the Northern temples?~

@40786 = ~Our rituals are not much different than the rest of the order.~
@40787 = ~The barbarians know him as "Tempos", and just that difference is a source of mistrust in itself. The native barbarians do not believe that foreigners understand what "Tempos" really stands for. We know that the barbarians are just a few peaks away and we immigrants understand the danger that they bring into our lives.~
@40788 = ~Yes. Like many of our faith, Everard has seen his share of battles, and of battle-wounds, and now his place is here.~
@40789 = ~I have come to pay my respects to Tempus, though Easthaven seems far removed from any battles. ~
@40790 = ~What holy site do you guard here?~
@40791 = ~A vision of our lord is no small matter. That was a powerful sign Jerrod received.~
@40792 = ~The manifestations of Tempus are open to interpretation. Are you so sure that his death was not in v—~
@40793 = ~We are both sworn to the Foehammer's service. With my aid, you are certain to succeed.~
@40794 = ~This is your purpose here, isn't it? To fulfill Tempus's will. I see it clearly now.~
@40795 = ~Do what you must, brother. I will witness your sacrifice.~
@40796 = ~You should know Tempus better, initiate.~
@40797 = ~This temple marks the field where the barbarian Jerrod gave up his life ages ago. He lies encased in stone beneath this temple.~
@40798 = ~Sacrifice? Let me say this of "sacrifice," *initiate*. Then we shall speak of this no more. Sacrifice is a death that has meaning. When it is in vain, it is not sacrifice. It is a *waste*. *That* is the lesson of Jerrod's Stone, not what your… misguided teachers have told you before.~ [EVER_41]
@40799 = ~I, too, serve Tempos. Would you impede me in my duties?~
@40800 = ~Outlanders do not understand Tempos as we do. Your visions are not those of our shaman.~
@40801 = ~I also serve the god of battles. Tell me of your vision.~
@40802 = ~The visions of Tempus are not always clear, but I believe your interpretation. What can we do?~
@40803 = ~The visions of Tempus are not always clear. We have other plans.~
@40804 = ~My faith in Tempus is the same as yours, regardless of what we choose to call Him.~
@40805 = ~no cosmetic attacks~
@40806 = ~Show attack animations only when characters are making real attacks. Otherwise, characters go through attack animations throughout a round to simulate feinting and dodging.~
@40807 = ~Disable Zoom~
@40808 = ~When this setting is enabled, the zoom level will be reset to the default value and any subsequent attempts to zoom in or out will be prevented.~
@40809 = ~To me, the word "barbarian" means freedom and the wind on my face. I do not see your people as savages.~

The text of the original Icewind Dale has been extensively revised for spelling, grammar, and accuracy. Spells and items in particular have been thoroughly examined and their descriptions overhauled to provide, to the best of our ability, correct and complete information in an easy-to-parse format.

Giuseppe Calì, K. Marshall, and Anders Svensson have significantly improved the quality of the text by suggesting numerous corrections to the game's descriptions, statistics, and grammar. K. Marshall and Anders Svensson have also been outstanding proofreaders for the Enhanced Edition manuals, Survival Guide to the North and Mastering Melee & Magic.

The efforts of these volunteers and many others have helped Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition become the polished experience it was intended to be. To these dedicated contributors, we would like to express our profound appreciation.

@40821 = %~Note di Traduzione~

La revisione e correzione della localizzazione in italiano di Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition (campagna base) e di Heart of Winter/Trials of the Luremaster (espansioni) è stata ultimata.

I filmati e i dialoghi doppiati in italiano sono stati tradotti in modo tale che vi sia piena corrispondenza tra parti testuali e tracce audio. Tuttavia, laddove le tracce audio presentavano termini di Dungeons & Dragons tradotti erroneamente, è stata adottata la traduzione ufficiale (ad esempio, "Spina Dorsale del Mondo" è stato corretto con l'espressione ufficiale "Dorso del Mondo"). 

Tutti gli elementi relativi all'universo di Dungeons & Dragons e all'Ambientazione Forgotten Realms, fra cui incantesimi, specializzazioni, classi, sottoclassi, abilità, oggetti, luoghi e personaggi, sono stati tradotti in italiano secondo la terminologia ufficiale adottata nei manuali di Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Seconda Edizione. Segue l'elenco del materiale principale di supporto:

Edizioni Twenty-Five Editions:
Manuale del Giocatore * Manuale del Dungeon Master
Manuale dei Mostri Volume I e II * Abilità e Poteri
Combattimento e Tattiche * Incantesimi e Magia
Dar Vita ai Reami * A Spasso per i Reami

Edizioni Ripa:
Manuale del Dungeon Master * Manuale dei Mostri

Data la mancata localizzazione italiana di numerosi manuali Advanced, il team si è dovuto avvalere delle successive pubblicazioni di Dungeons & Dragons Terza Edizione (3.0/3.5 Twenty-Five Editions) nel pieno rispetto delle fonti canoniche. Segue l'elenco dell'ulteriore materiale:

Forgotten Realms Ambientazione * Fedi e Pantheon
Magia di Faerûn * Guida del Giocatore a Faerûn
Razze di Faerûn * Imperi Perduti di Faerûn
Signori dell'Oscurità * Splendente Sud
Irraggiungibile Est * Marche d'Argento
Manuale del Giocatore * Guida del Dungeon Master
Manuale dei Mostri * Manuale dei Mostri II
Manuale dei Piani * Atlante Planare

In ogni altro caso, come nei termini senza precedenti, la trasposizione in italiano ha cercato di essere il più fedele possibile all’originale inglese.%

By casting this spell, the priest deals 1d8 + 1/level points of damage to nearby enemies. A successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures. It can only be cast by evil-aligned characters.~

Casting this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining <PRO_HIMHER> of 2 levels of experience. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures. It can only be cast by evil-aligned characters.~

This powerful spell causes the organs of the touched creature to cease functioning and wither away unless a Save vs. Death at a penalty of -4 is made. The creature affected will lose 3 Hit Points per second. The effect lasts for 1 round per 2 levels of the caster or until dispelled. For example, a 14th-level priest would cause the targeted creature to lose 18 Hit Points per round for 7 rounds. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or extraplanar creatures.

Unfortunately, the female version of the dialogues was not there, so I had to add it by myself (for this reason some related phrases may be missing).

In CIS was published two official Russian translations of IWD. Beamdog company also have rights to a translation released by 1C. Their localization is used also. I took from there the most successful variants of words and sentences, in order to replace the "weak points" in a translation by Akella.

I should also mention the person with a nickname Prozh, who translated the first part of Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition. With his permission I've used this translation in the identical materials.

I express my gratitude to all who took a part in Russian translation of Icewind Dale, directly or not.

They directly tap into the energies that flow through the earth and air, through plants and animals, and even through the dead, and shape these energies to obey their will. Nowhere is this more evident than in their ability to summon powerful spirits as guardians and defenders. A being of two worlds, Shamans value balance over dominance.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May only wear leather, studded leather, and hide armor.
– May not equip shields larger than bucklers.
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, club, spear, axe, quarterstaff, dart, sling, and shortbow.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any fighting style.
– May cast druidic spells.
– Does not automatically learn all spells of a given level as Druids do. Instead, Shamans select new spells to learn at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.
– Gains immediate access to a number of Shaman-specific spells, which can be cast like any other: Spirit Ward, Writhing Fog, Spiritual Clarity, Spirit Fire, Recall Spirit, Spiritual Lock, and Ether Gate.
– Gains use of the Detect Illusion skill with 20% points as a base and an 4 points per level, up to a maximum of 100% at level 20.
– May use Shamanic Dance at will.

SHAMANIC DANCE: Shamans can summon spirit allies by performing a ritualistic dance. While dancing, the Shaman takes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and cannot move, attack, cast spells, use items and special abilities, or perform any other activity. Each round while the Shaman dances, there is a 35% base chance plus 2% for each level of the Shaman that a spirit will answer the call, up to a maximum of 75% at level 20. Any summoned spirits will disappear if the Shaman moves, stops dancing, or if the spirits leave visual range. The spirits grow in power as the Shaman gains additional levels:
  Level 1: Minor animal spirits (snake, fox, hound), up to 2 spirits at the same time.
  Level 6: Major animal spirits (bear, panther, boar), up to 3 spirits at the same time.
  Level 12: Minor nature spirits (lesser air spirit, lesser earth spirit, lesser fire spirit), up to 4 spirits at the same time.
  Level 18: Major nature spirits (air spirit, earth spirit, fire spirit), up to 5 spirits at the same time.
The type of the summoned spirit is randomly determined from all the spirits available at the Shaman's level. For example, a level 12 Shaman will summon either a minor nature spirit, a major animal spirit, or a minor animal spirit, but cannot choose which one appears. Spirits will do their best to protect the Shaman but are not controlled directly.

– Does not gain bonus spells per day from high Wisdom.
– Alignment restricted to neutral good, true neutral, and neutral evil.
– Hit Die: d8~

As the Shaman casts this spell, energies gather together from the spirit world and form a pale blue sphere. The Shaman can throw the sphere so that it explodes into a burst of ghostly, azure flames, which deliver 1d4 points of magic damage per level of the Shaman (up to a maximum of 10d4). There is also a 33% chance that every enemy within the area of effect will be afflicted by the Doom spell (-2 penalty to Saving Throws and attack rolls for 1 turn). A successful Save vs. Spell halves the damage and negates the Doom effect. Spirits, fey creatures, elementals, and spectral undead take double damage.~

This spell transports one creature, chosen by the caster, to the Ethereal Plane. The creature vanishes for the spell's duration, at which point it returns to the physical world in the exact same spot where it was before. While in the Ethereal Plane, the victim cannot interact with anyone or anything that resides on the Prime Material Plane. There is no saving throw against this spell, though it is subject to magic resistance. Friendly creatures can lower their magic resistance so that the shaman can target them with this spell. In addition, Ether Gate is blocked by spells and abilities that protect against maze effects.~

Ghostly figures called by the Shaman swirl around the battlefield, tormenting the Shaman's adversaries. All enemies within the area of effect take 3d8 points of magic damage per round for the next 3 rounds (no save). In addition, all living enemies (undead and constructs are unaffected) must save vs. Spell or lose 2 points of Strength every round for 5 rounds.

Just as balance is required within the world, it’s necessary between the worlds, so sometimes you must be a road, sometimes a border, sometimes a wall. It’s a path little understood, but never lonely, surrounded as you are by the immaterial.

In recent days, the spirits have grown agitated in a way you’ve never seen. The web of connection between all things is shaking, a disturbance carried by the souls of air and earth, life and even death shrinking from the unnatural. Evil creatures, the enemies of balance, stir in the depths. The whispering of your constant companions tell you the source lies somewhere in the North. You know your duty, and will travel to the Spine of the World to seek out the source of the spirits’ distress. The balance must be maintained.~
